**DRAFT**
The Rhododendron Research Network (R-RN) GitHub is intended to foster the exchange of scientific ideas, providing participants with an opportunity to participate in research, establish/renew collaborations, to learn, teach, and network with a diverse community of professional and citizen scientists.

R-RN chair and working group leaders are committed to creating an environment where everyone can participate without harassment, discrimination, or violence of any kind.

All participants must be treated with respect and consideration.

Participation in R-RN working group activities, including this GitHub Repository, is considered an agreement to abide by this policy.

Harassment of any R-RN associate or participant will not be tolerated, either in person or online. Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to • offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), nationality, native language, or technology choices • unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, or employment • sustained or willful disruption of discussions, talks, or other events, including online discussion. • deliberate intimidation • continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease • unwanted photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes • pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others • inappropriate physical contact without consent or after a request to stop. In virtual settings, inappropriate simulated physical contact used without consent, such as textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub” or emojis representing such contacts. • stalking or following, including in virtual settings behavior such as persistent unwanted direct messages, sending unwanted pictures or malware links, or logging online activity for harassment purposes. • threats of violence or incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm • use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes • unwelcome sexual attention, which can include inappropriate questions of a sexual nature, asking for sexual favors, or repeatedly asking for dates or contact information. • deliberate ‘outing’ of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse • deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names • non-consensual publication of non-harassing private communication, including screenshots of private discussion channels or direct messages. We prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding: • ‘reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’ • reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you” • communicating in a ’tone’ you don’t find congenial • criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

Anyone violating the code of conduct may be: (a) asked to stop, (b) prohibited from participating in working group/network activities, and/or (c) expelled from the working group/network.

This Code of Conduct applies to all people participating in the R-RN, including committee members and leadership. It applies to all modes of interaction online including GitHub project repositories, the R-RN discussion forum, Zoom, Community Calls, and in person at R-RN-hosted events or events officially endorsed by R-RN, including social gatherings affiliated with the event.
