## Description
Slender shrub to 2m. Twigs 1–2mm in diameter, at first densely covered with stalked stellate scales, glabrescent and densely warty later, without hairs; internodes 2.5–6cm. Leaves 3–5 together in tight pseudowhorls. Blade 8–50 x 5–25mm, obovate-elliptic or obovate; apex obtuse to rounded, not apiculate; margin cartilaginous, distinctly revolute; base tapering; sub-densely or laxly scaly on both sides initially, glabrescent and shining above with age, persistently scaly beneath. Scales flat, marginal zone irregularly stellately lobed; centre impressed, eventually glabrescent beneath leaving only impressed black points. Mid-vein impressed above, obtusely prominent beneath; lateral veins c.3 per side, obscure above, somewhat raised and curved-anastomosing beneath, reticulation obscure. Petiole 2–3 x 0.8–1mm, almost rounded in section, scaly. Flower buds to 12 x 7mm, ovate, smooth. Bracts to 10 x 5mm, the outermost subulate with a few scales outside, then ovate, often with a mucronate point, membranous, minutely hairy outside but without scales except along the margins. Flowers solitary or paired, hanging vertically. Pedicels 8–20mm, slender, densely covered with reddish-brown, stellate scales and short spreading hairs. Calyx c.2.5mm in diameter, obliquely disc-shaped, shortly obtusely 5-lobed, scaly outside. Corolla 15–55mm, tubular, bright red, sometimes with a darker purplish margin to the lobes; tube 8–45 x 3–4 x 12–15mm, laxly stellate-scaly and minutely hairy outside, glabrous inside, somewhat curved; lobes 8–10 x 6–8mm, half-spreading, broadly obovate or sub-circular. Stamens exserted to c.5mm; filaments linear, glabrous; anthers 1.8–2 x c.1mm, obovate-oblong. Disc prominent, glabrous below, hairy on the upper margin. Ovary c.4 x 1.5mm, sub-cylindrical, slightly tapering at the base, densely shortly patent-hairy and sub-densely scaly; style slender, as long as the stamens, patently hairy in the lower 1⁄3–½; stigma sub-globose. Fruit c.40 x 6mm, cylindrical, laxly hairy and scaly.
