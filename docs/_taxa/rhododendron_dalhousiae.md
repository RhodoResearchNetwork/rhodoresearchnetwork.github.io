Epiphytic or more rarely free-growing shrub. Young shoots loriform-setose. Leaves mostly narrowly elliptic, more rarely tending to obovate, (75-)100-170 x 35-70 mm, tapered to the base and to the ± rounded apex, petioles variably loriform-ciliate, lower surface greyish or brownish green with small, slightly unequal, reddish scales more than their own diameter apart; margins often crenulate. Inflorescence 2-3-flowered, pedicels 15-20 mm, lepidote and pubescent, accrescent in fruit. Calyx conspicuous, deeply 5-lobed, the lobes oblong or oblong-triangular, rounded at the apex, 10-15 x 5-10 mm, lepidote at the base, the middles of the lobes with few to many filiform-acicular hairs. Corolla narrowly funnel-campanulate to funnel-campanulate, white or cream, often yellowish inside, sometimes with 5 red lines running from the base of the tube to the apices of the lobes, 85-105 mm, tube 60-75 mm, very sparsely lepidote to elepidote outside. Stamens 10, filaments pubescent in the lower part. Ovary lepidote, tapered into the style which is lepidote in the lower part. Capsule cylindric-fusiform, 40-50 x 15-20 mm, lepidote, rather strongly 5-ridged. ** * Rhododendron dalhousiae * var. * dalhousiae * ** Corolla without 5 longitudinal red lines ** * Rhododendron dalhousiae * var. * rhabdotum * ** Corolla with 5 longitudinal red lines
