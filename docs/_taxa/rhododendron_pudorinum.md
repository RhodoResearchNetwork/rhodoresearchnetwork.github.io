## Description
Tree to 4m. Twigs 5–7mm in diameter, angular to rounded, densely brown-scaly, early glabrescent; internodes 12cm or more, with conspicuous rounded lateral buds. Leaves laxly spirally arranged. Blade 50–90 x 30–55mm, broadly elliptic to nearly rounded or obovate-elliptic; apex shortly (5mm) acuminate or apiculate or blunt; margin entire or obscurely crenulate, slightly revolute; base broadly tapering, truncate or rounded, sometimes a little decurrent; glabrescent and impressed-punctate above when mature in dry specimens, very densely, to overlapping, reddish-brown-scaly beneath, irregularly scattered over the surface a few much larger scales. Scales rounded, lobed or stellate, with broad pale brown marginal flanges and small dark brown impressed centres. Mid-vein thick and prominent near the base, gradually flattened and sometimes grooved above, flat or weakly raised beneath; lateral veins 5–6 per side, steeply ascending and only slightly prominent above and below, the larger ones narrowly grooved above, laxly reticulate, veinlets almost obscure above, more visible beneath. Petiole 5–8 x 3–4mm, flattened without a groove when fresh, initially scaly. Flower buds c.20 x 15mm, broadly ovoid. Bracts to 13mm; outer bracts sub-circular, inner ones broadly spathulate, obtuse with silky hairs on both sides and scaly outside. Bracteoles c.10 x 2mm, linear-spathulate, densely long-hairy. Inflorescence an 8–15-flowered umbel. Pedicels 20–25 x c.0.8mm, densely scaly, without hairs. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, disc-shaped, thick-membranous, wavy and indistinctly lobed at the margin, densely scaly outside, fringed by scales which project beyond the margin. Corolla c.40 x 30mm, pink; tube 22–25 x 4–6 x 7–8mm, straight, cylindrical but flaring just below the lobes, laxly to very laxly scaly outside, glabrous inside; lobes 11–14 x 10–12mm, broadly obovate to nearly rounded, often slightly retuse. Stamens somewhat longer than the corolla tube, unequal; filaments linear below, filiform distally, glabrous; anthers c.2.5mm, broadly sub-obovate-oblong. Disc thick, glabrous. Ovary c.5 x 3mm, obconical, very densely covered with sub-patent, short yellowish hairs which cover scales, shortly contracted distally; style c.20–25mm, hairy and scaly at the base, glabrous otherwise, thick; stigma weakly lobed. Fruit 25–30 x c.6mm, sub-cylindrical, the apex acuminate, the base tapering, slightly thicker in the upper 1⁄3, densely hairy and scaly.
