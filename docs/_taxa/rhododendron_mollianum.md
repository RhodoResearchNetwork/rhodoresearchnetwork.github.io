## Description
Terrestrial shrub to 1m. Twigs rounded, 2–5mm in diameter; internodes laxly minutely scaly, lower ones glabrescent and corky, 6–15cm. Leaves 4–5 together in pseudo­whorls with subulate cataphylls associated with them. Blade 110–160 x 15–30mm, narrowly elliptic; apex narrowly acute, caudate-acuminate; margin strongly but narrowly revolute; base narrowly tapering, glabrescent above with age, laxly scaly for some time beneath but eventually glabrescent. Scales minute, marginal zone irregularly sub-stellately lobed and quickly disappearing; centre shallowly impressed. Mid-vein narrow and impressed above except for the broad base; obtusely prominent beneath; lateral veins 10–14 per side, irregular, spreading, obscurely anastomosing near the edge, slightly impressed above and raised beneath, reticulation obscure above, dense and finely prominent beneath. Petiole 5–7 x 1–1.5mm, rugose, grooved above. Inflorescence c.3-flowered, an open umbel. Pedicels 25–30 x 0.7mm, laxly scaly, without hairs. Calyx c.3mm in diameter, disc-shaped, faintly lobed, oblique. Corolla 65–70mm, funnel-shaped, orange, suffused with red; tube c.25 x 5 x 10mm, sparsely minutely scaly outside, laxly hairy inside, markedly pouched proximally; lobes 40–45 x c.20mm, spreading, obovate-elliptic. Stamens sub-equal, exserted to 20mm; filaments linear and sub-densely to laxly hairy in the proximal 1⁄3, becoming nearly filiform and glabrous distally; anthers 5 x 1mm, elongate-oblong, slightly curved. Disc prominent, shortly greyish hairy. Ovary c.8 x 2mm, sub-cylindrical, tapering distally, densely minutely scaly and shortly hairy, the scales clearly visible between the hairs; style shortly hairy in the proximal ¼–1⁄3, hairy and scaly, or scaly only above, slender, equalling the stamens; stigma lobed.
