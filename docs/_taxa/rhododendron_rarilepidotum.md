## Description
Shrub to 4m. Twigs 4–5mm in diameter, rounded, internodes laxly to densely scaly, becoming glabrescent, smooth; internodes 4–11cm. Leaves 3–7 in loose pseudo­whorls. Blade 50–90 x 20–35mm, elliptic, rarely slightly obovate-elliptic; apex shortly acuminate, acute or broadly acute; margin entire, flat or weakly and narrowly revolute; base narrowly to broadly tapering; densely scaly on both sides at first, glabrescent above when mature but minutely blackish punctate where the scales have been, laxly to sub-densely and persistently scaly beneath. Scales small, marginal zone irregularly sub-stellately lobed, disintegrating with age; centres dark, large, minutely but visibly impressed. Mid-vein slightly raised above in the proximal ½, often grooved in this part also, smooth or a little impressed distally; beneath shallowly raised in the proximal ½–¾, smooth distally; lateral veins 6–10 per side, wide-spreading, smooth or very slightly raised above, smooth and often obscure beneath, reticulation obscure. Petiole 7–18 x 3–4mm, smooth or grooved distally, scaly. Bracts to 25 x 12mm, membranous, glabrous, outer ones ovate, sub-obtuse, inner ones ovate-elliptic, slightly keeled. Bracteoles c.20 x 1.5mm, linear below, sub-spathulate distally, glabrous. Inflorescence a full or semi-open umbel of 6–12 flowers held semi-erect to horizontal. Pedicels 15–20 x c.1mm, laxly to sub-densely scaly. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, oblique, rim-like, wavy. Corolla 20–25 x 35–40mm, broadly funnel-shaped, orange, often darker at the base of the tube, or yellow, sometimes scented; tube 12–20 x 8–9 x 16–18mm, base slightly 5-lobed, laxly scaly or glabrous outside, glabrous inside; lobes 13–19 x 12–17mm, obovate-sub-circular, reflexing to the perpendicular, overlapping c.halfway. Stamens exserted to c.10mm, spreading all round the flower, unequal; filaments linear, glabrous; anthers 2–3 x 1.3mm, obtuse at the base. Disc prominent, glabrous. Ovary 4–6 x 2–2.5mm, sub-cylindric-conical, mostly glabrous from the beginning, rarely laxly scaly at first, becoming glabrous during the flowering, abruptly contracted distally; style 12–18mm, slender; stigma 2–3mm in diameter, lobes distinct. Fruit 25–30 x 5–7mm, fusiform, often slightly curved, glabrous.
