## Description
Shrub or small tree to 3m. Twigs 2–4mm in diameter, appressed scaly at first, quickly glabrescent and smooth; internodes 1.5–2.5cm. Leaves 3–6 together in tight pseudo­whorls. Blade 30–90 x 12–25mm, obovate or elliptic; apex broadly tapering, obtuse to rounded, sometimes apiculate with a terminal gland; margin narrowly cartil­aginous, slightly revolute; base broadly tapering, rarely rounded; densely scaly at first on both sides, glabrescent above, laxly persistently scaly beneath. Scales small, marginal zone very thin, quickly disappearing, lobed; centre minute, dark and impressed. Mid-vein deeply impressed above, prominently raised below, often becoming broader near the base; lateral veins 6–8 per side, irregularly curved-upwards, anastomosing, faintly impressed in old leaves above, a little prominent beneath, reticulation lax, visible beneath only. Petiole 5–9 x 1–1.5mm, grooved above, flat, laxly scaly. Bracts to 12 x 5mm, ovate-acuminate, laxly scaly outside or glabrous. Bracteoles c.10mm, filiform below, slightly dilated distally. Inflorescence 3–6-flowered open umbels, the flowers hanging. Pedicels 8–20mm, slender, laxly to sub-densely scaly. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, disc-shaped, irregularly and shortly 5-lobed, glabrous. Corolla 20–60mm, tubular-funnel-shaped, bright red; tube 18–50 x c.4 x 7–12mm, laxly scaly outside, glabrous inside or laxly hairy, tube slightly to distinctly curved; lobes 12–15 x 10–13mm, spreading, broadly obovate-spathulate, sometimes with a few scales outside. Stamens clustered on the upper side of the flower, at the mouth or exserted to 6mm; filaments linear and laxly papillose-hairy proximally for c.2⁄3, glabrous and filiform distally; anthers c.2.5 x 1mm, oblong. Disc very prominent, glabrous. Ovary c.7 x 2mm, obovoid-cylindrical, densely scaly, but without hairs, gradually tapering distally; style slender, scaly at the base, glabrous distally, becoming slightly exserted; stigma thick, rounded. Fruit 40–50 x 5–7mm, sub-cylindrical, slightly curved, sub-densely scaly. Seeds 3mm, without tails c.0.8mm, the longest tail 1.3mm.
