## Description
Shrub to 3m. Twigs smooth, finely longitudinally striated when dry and with scattered dark-brown scales; internodes 5–12cm. Leaves 3–5 together in tight pseudow­horls. Blade 40–80 x 23–37mm, elliptic, narrowly ovate or obovate; apex broadly acute, obtuse or rounded; margin entire, slightly revolute; base broadly tapering to rounded; laxly silvery scaly but quickly glabrescent and dark green above, persistently laxly scaly and paler below. Scales rounded, variable in size, with a broad marginal flange and small centre. Mid-vein distinct, above broad at the base and longitudinally grooved but quickly tapering to a narrow, impressed channel, green; broad and strongly raised throughout its length below, deep reddish-purple; lateral veins 7–9 per side, issuing at an angle of 45–90°, strongly impressed above, almost to the leaf edge, giving a rugose surface, very prominent and red in colour below. Petiole 8–12 x 3–4mm, red, weakly grooved above, scaly. Flower buds to c.20 x 10mm, glossy dark purplish-red, elliptic. Bracts ovate, often with a dark purple median line, the tips of the bracts broadly pointed and reflexed to c.4mm, these tips scaly both inside and out. Inflorescence a 6–10-flowered open or one-sided umbel, the flowers semi-erect to horizontal, white, or pale pink, fragrant. Pedicels red, 12–26 x c.2mm, minutely rough with scales and short simple hairs. Calyx a low lobed scaly and hairy ring, 1–1.5mm high. Corolla 40–46 x 35–45mm; tube 35–40 x 9 x 5mm, straight, covered in scales outside, densely short-hairy inside near the base; lobes 18 x 14–18mm, slightly forward pointing or spreading to the perpendicular, overlapping to c.halfway, slightly scaly outside. Stamens irregular in length, included c.2mm below the mouth; filaments white or pale pink, tapering slightly distally, hairy throughout their length; anthers c.2.8 x 1.25mm, brown with a finely granular surface and oblique pores. Disc lobed, with short erect hairs. Ovary 5.5 x 3.5mm, ovoid to almost conical, tapering slightly towards both base and apex, densely scaly and covered in short forwardly directed hairs; style 37 x c.1mm, sparsely scaly in the lower 1⁄3 and with forwardly directed, semi-patent hairs to within 3–4mm of the stigma; stigma irregularly lobed, c.1mm, cream, eventually protruding to 6mm from the mouth of the flower. Fruit 17–25 x 4–7mm, narrowly ellipsoid, strongly longitudinally grooved. Seeds 4–4.5mm, without tails c.1.1mm, the longest tail to 1.9mm.
