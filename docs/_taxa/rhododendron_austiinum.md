## Description
Shrub or small tree to 5m tall, usually non-rhizomatous; young twigs red-brown, densely covered with unicellular hairs and multicellular gland-tipped hairs. Vegetative bud scales densely covered with unicellular hairs abaxially; margin glandular. Leaf blade membranaceous, ovate or obovate to elliptic, (4.7-)5.4-8.8(-10.0) x (2.1-)2.2-3.2(-3.9)cm; base acute to oblique; apex acute to obtuse, often mucronate; adaxial surface densely covered with unicellular hairs, or widi unicellular hairs and multicellular gland-tipped hairs, the midvein densely covered with unicellular hairs; abaxial surface densely covered with unicellular hairs, the midvein densely covered with unicellular hairs and multicellular gland-tipped hairs; margin entire, ciliate with multicellular eglandular and gland-tipped hairs; petiole 0.2-0.5cm long, densely covered with unicellular hairs and multicellular gland-tipped hairs. Flower bud scales chestnut brown; abaxial surface densely covered with unicellular hairs; margin glandular. Flowers appearing before or with the leaves; inflorescence a shortened raceme of 10 to 24 flowers. Pedicels (0.5-)0.6-l.l(-1.7)cm long, densely covered with unicellular hairs and multicellular gland-tipped hairs. Sepals less than 0.1-0.2cm long, often varying in length on the same flower; margins glandular-fimbriate; abaxial surface densely covered with unicellular hairs and multicellular gland-tipped hairs. Corolla yellow, apricot or orange to red-orange, fragrance musky-sweet, the tube longer than the limb and gradually expanding into it; upper corolla lobe 0.9-1.4(-l.8) x 0.6-1.2(-1.4)cm; lateral lobes (l.l-)1.2-1.7(-2.0)x0.5-0.9(-l.l)cm; corolla tube 1.8-2.3(-2.4)cm long, 0.2-0.4(-0.5)cm wide at base; outer surface of corolla sparsely to densely covered with unicellular hairs and multicellular gland-tipped hairs; inner surface of corolla sparsely to densely covered with unicellular hairs. Stamens (5.2-)5.4-6.8(-7.7)cm long, with dense terete or flattened unicellular hairs on proximal (2.5-)2.8-3.6(-3.7)cm of filament, exserted (3.3-)3.5-4.8(-5.7)cm beyond throat of corolla. Style (5.4-)5.5-6.8(-7.5)cm long, exserted (3.2-)3.6-4.9(-5.5)cm beyond throat of corolla, with dense unicellular hairs on proximal (0.3-)0.5-1.7(-2.2)cm; stigma 0.1-0.2(-0.3)cm wide. Ovary 0.3-0.5(-0.6)cm long, 0.1-0.2cm wide at the base, densely covered with multicellular gland-tipped hairs and unicellular hairs, or also with multicellular eglandular hairs. Capsules (1.4-) 1.6-2.3 (-2.5) x (0.3-)0.4-0.5cm, narrowly ovate, moderately to densely covered with unicellular hairs and sparsely to moderately densely covered with multicellular gland-tipped hairs. Seeds pale to dark chestnut brown, ovate or elliptic to fusiform, (l.l-)1.7-2.8(-2.9) x 0.7-0.9(-1.0)mm, body 1.0ó1.5(ó1.7) x (0.2-)0.3-0.5(-0.6)mm; testa expanded and dorsiventrally flattened, surrounding the body, the cells short throughout, with transverse end-walls
