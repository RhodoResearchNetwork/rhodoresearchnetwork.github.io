Blade 40–80 x 25–45mm, obovate; apex obtuse or rounded, sometimes slightly emarginate; margin narrowly cartilaginous, flat, sub-serrulate-crenulate; base tapering; glabrescent above at maturity, sub-densely scaly below. Scales small, rounded, large, marginal zone variously angular or lobed; centre minute and distinctly impressed. Mid-vein narrowly impressed above, thick, flattened and obtusely prominent beneath; lateral veins 6–8 per side, lower two from near the base, the others at an angle of c.45°, all high-ascending and curved-anastomosing before the margin, slightly impressed above and raised beneath, reticulation inconspicuous. Petiole 3–6 x 2.5–3.5mm, grooved above, scaly. Bracts to 18 x 13mm, ovate, laxly scaly outside, apices obtuse or rounded; inner bracts obovate-spathulate, to 25 x 10mm.
