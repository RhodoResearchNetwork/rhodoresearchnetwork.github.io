## Description
Much-branched shrub to 3m. Twigs 1.5–3mm in diameter, rounded, often red, at first sub-densely covered with flat, sub-stellate scales, becoming glabrescent; internodes 2–8.5cm. Leaves 5–7 together in pseudowhorls, unequal. Blade 25–80 x 15–40mm, obovate or obovate-elliptic; apex obtuse or rounded, often emarginate; margin flat, or weakly and narrowly recurved, base tapering and a little decurrent, glabrescent above at maturity, sub-densely and persistently scaly beneath. Scales small, marginal zone irregularly lobed; centre dark and impressed. Mid-vein narrowly impressed above, obtusely prominent proximally beneath; lateral veins 4–6 per side, spreading, distinctly impressed above and raised beneath, often inconspicuous on both sides, reticulation obscure. Petiole 4–10 x c.1.5mm, red, somewhat flattened, grooved above, densely scaly. Flower buds to 8 x 5mm, ovoid; outer bracts sub-circular, inner ones ovate to oblong-ovate, obtuse to acute, white or grey appressed hairy in the upper, outer part, with both scales and hairs along the margins. Inflorescence a 1–4-flowered open umbel, the flowers hanging vertically. Pedicels 10–18mm, slender, densely sub-stellate-scaly, without hairs. Calyx 4–5mm in diameter, obliquely disc-shaped, very shortly obtusely lobed. Corolla 25–30 x 34mm, campanulate or broadly funnel-shaped, bright orange-red, without scent; tube 10–12 x 8–9 x 15–16mm, straight, laxly sub-stellately scaly outside, glabrous inside; lobes 15–18 x 14–16mm, curving outwards and overlapping to ¾, slightly emarginate. Stamens regularly to irregularly arranged in the centre of the flower, exserted to c.6mm; anthers 2–2.5 x c.1mm, obovate-oblong, base sub-obtuse, pale brown, strongly curving inwards; filaments orange, linear, dilated and patently hairy for 2–4mm at the base, glabrous and filiform distally. Disc glabrous, not very prominent. Ovary 4.5 x 3–3.5mm, ovoid-conical, patently long hairy, abruptly contracted distally; style 8–10mm, depressed to the lower side of the flower, glabrous; stigma green, thick-obconical. Fruit 18–30 x 7–9mm, ellipsoid, densely patently hairy and scaly, green often flushed with red, the valves spreading and twisting on opening, the placentae remaining coherent. Seeds 4.5–6mm, without tails 0.8–1mm, the longest tail 3.2mm.
