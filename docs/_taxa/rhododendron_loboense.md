## Description
Shrub to 1.5m. Twigs c.5mm in diameter, rounded, glabrous or sparsely scaly, with large flat fragile scales. Leaves spirally arranged with conspicuous, spherical buds in the upper axils. Blade 100–120 x 40–60mm, elliptic, apex sometimes shortly acuminate, broadly acute to obtuse; margin narrowly but distinctly revolute; base broadly tapering, occasionally rounded, glabrescent above at maturity; laxly and more persistently scaly beneath. Scales small, marginal zone irregularly lobed; centre weakly or not impressed. Mid-vein strong, raised above in the proximal ½, smooth distally, raised beneath throughout, as broad as the petiole proximally, grad­ually narrowed upwards; lateral veins 12–15 per side, at an acute angle, indistinctly anastomosing, prominent or barely distinct on both sides, reticulation mostly visible beneath only. Petiole 10–20 x 2.5–3mm, without a groove, scaly, somewhat flattened. Flower buds to 40 x 20mm, shortly ovoid, shortly pointed, pale yellowish-green, smooth with the bracts appressed. Bracts broadly ovate, glabrous except for minute, fragile scales on the margins. Inflorescence 4–7-flowered, in slightly open umbels. Pedicels 10–20 x c.2mm, expanded to c.5mm just below the calyx, glabrous to laxly scaly. Calyx 4–5mm in diameter, disc-like, margin thickened, wavy and faintly lobed, glabrous. Corolla 35–40 x 50–60mm, funnel-shaped, held horizontally to semi-erect, yellow, without scent; tube 20–22 x 9–11 x 24–30mm, glabrous on both sides; lobes 20–29 x 20–24mm, unequal, oval, reflexed to horizontal, overlapping to c.½. Stamens irregularly arranged, exserted 5–8mm, slightly dimorphic; filaments linear, glabrous, c.25mm; anthers 4 x 1mm, strongly incurved, yellow, oblong, base obtuse. Disc glabrous or with a few sparse hairs, deeply lobed. Ovary 7–10 x 3–5mm, sub-obovoid-cylindrical, glabrous or with a few scattered scales, abruptly contracted distally; style 13–17 x 1.25mm, glabrous; stigma 5mm in diameter, yellow, circular, thick and lobed. Fruit 25–45 x 6–9mm, fusiform. Seeds 6–7mm, without tails c.1.2mm, the longest tail 3.8mm.
