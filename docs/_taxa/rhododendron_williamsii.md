## Description
Tree to 6m. Twigs 2–3mm in diameter, rounded, at first laxly scaly, later glabrescent, often whitish; internodes 3–10cm. Leaves 3–4 together in pseudowhorls. Blade 80–110 x 30–50mm, elliptic-ovate, or elliptic; apex mucronate, acute; margin entire, narrowly or not revolute; base broadly to narrowly tapering, glabrescent above with age, laxly scaly beneath initially. Scales small, flat, irregularly lobed in the very thin, fragile marginal zone; centre slightly darker, weakly impressed, finally glabrescent beneath also, leaving shallow dark pits. Mid-vein broad (1.5–2mm) at the base, quickly narrowed distally, impressed in the upper 2⁄3 above, prominent below throughout its length; lateral veins 6–10 per side, diverging at c.45° somewhat ascending, slightly impressed or raised above, more conspicuously prominent beneath, obscurely anastomosing before the margin, reticulation inconspicuous. Petiole 10–20 x 1.5–2.5mm, somewhat flattened, scaly. Bracts to 20 x 10mm; outer bracts broadly ovate, mucronate, c.15 x 12mm, with a few scales outside; inner ones broadly elliptic or elliptic, obtuse, margin very shallowly impressed with the attachments of fragile scales. Bracteoles to 20 x 0.5mm, linear, glabrous. Inflor­escence a 5–8-flowered open umbel. Pedicels 20–25 x c.1mm, very densely covered with reddish-brown flat scales, especially towards the apex, without hairs. Calyx 4–5mm in diameter, oblique, disc-shaped, shortly irregularly 5-lobed, the lobes up to 1mm. Corolla 25–40 x c.30mm, funnel-shaped, white, sparsely scaly or glabrous outside, glabrous inside; tube 18–23 x 6–7 x 10–16mm, base 5-pouched; lobes 10–15 x 10–15mm, obovate-sub-circular. Stamens exserted to c.5mm; filaments linear, glabrous; anthers c.3 x 1mm, oblong, each cell with a short basal apiculus. Disc glabrous, prominent, deeply lobed. Ovary 5–8 x 2.5–3mm, sub-ovoid-cylindric, initially with dense, flat, reddish-brown, stellate scales, becoming glabrescent, sub-abruptly contracted distally; style c.20mm, scaly in the proximal ½–2⁄3, glabrous distally; stigma 3mm in diameter, thick. Fruit 25–30 x 6–7mm, fusiform. Seeds 5–6 x 0.2mm including the tails.
