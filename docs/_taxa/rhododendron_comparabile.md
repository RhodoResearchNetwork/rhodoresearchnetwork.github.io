## Description
Erect shrub to 2m. Twigs 2–4mm in diameter, semi-rounded, laxly and deciduously sub-stellately scaly when young, sometimes whitish; internodes 2–11cm. Leaves 4–5 together in pseudowhorls. Blade 35–90 x 25–50mm, elliptic to sub-obovate-elliptic; apex broadly tapering or very shortly sub-abruptly acuminate, obtuse, sometimes rounded; margin narrowly but distinctly revolute; base broadly tapering, glabrescent above when mature, laxly, sub-persistently scaly beneath. Scales minute, marginal zone irregularly sub-stellately lobed; centre slightly impressed. Mid-vein narrowly impressed above, thick and obtusely prominent beneath; lateral veins 5–9 per side, spreading, sometimes irregular, often divided before the margin, mostly sub-parallel to each other and distinctly curved-anastomosing, slightly impressed above, somewhat raised beneath, reticulation faintly impressed above in old leaves, often inconspicuous. Petiole 10–23 x 1–2mm, semi-rounded, grooved above. Bracts to 20 x 15mm; outer bracts ovate, sub-acuminate, or circular, scaly along the midline distally outside; inner bracts obovate to spathulate, glabrescent or glabrous apart from marginal scales. Bracteoles 15 x 0.5–1.5mm, linear-spathulate, glabrous. Inflorescence an open 8–13-flowered umbel. Pedicels 20–30 x c.1mm, densely sub-stellately scaly. Calyx c.3mm in diameter, obliquely disc-shaped, shortly and bluntly 5-lobed, scaly outside. Corolla 40–48 x 50mm, funnel-shaped, white, scented; tube c.25 x 5–6 x 8–12mm, straight, sub-cylindrical, lobed at the base, laxly to sub-densely covered with minute sub-stellate scales outside, shortly hairy inside; lobes 15–20 x 15–20mm, broadly obovate or sub-circular, spreading. Stamens sub-equal, exserted; filaments linear and laxly patently hairy in the lower 2⁄3, more filiform and glabrous distally; anthers 3–3.5 x 0.8mm, narrowly oblong. Disc low, glabrous. Ovary 5–6 x c.2mm, sub-cylindrical, densely covered with forwardly directed hairs which cover the scales, tapering distally; style slightly shorter than the stamens, densely hairy and scaly for the proximal ¾, scaly at the apex; stigma deeply 5-lobed. Fruit 30–35 x 5–6mm, sub-cylindrical. Seeds very narrow, 4–5mm including the long tails.
