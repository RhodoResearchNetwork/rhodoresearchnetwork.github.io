## Description
Terrestrial, erect, branching shrub, c.50cm. Twigs erect, slender, rounded, 1–2mm in diameter, tips laxly scaly, glabrescent below. Leaves crowded especially at the tips of the new shoots. Blade 8–15 x 3–6mm, elliptic or obovate; apex abruptly acuminate; margin thickened and a little paler than the lamina, sub-crenulate where impressed scales are, or have been, slightly or not revolute; base acutely tapering, dark green above, lighter green below, sub-densely scaly on both sides initially, glabrescent and shiny above at maturity, persistently scaly below. Scales the marginal zones entire and somewhat irregular, impressed with thickened centres. Mid-vein impressed above, raised beneath; lateral veins obscure. Petiole 2–3mm, slender, flattened, laxly scaly. Outer bracts 6–10mm, ovate-acuminate, subulate or apiculate, laxly scaly and very laxly hairy; inner bracts broader, obovate, apiculate and very laxly scaly outside. Inflorescence of solitary flowers or in twos. Flowers half-hanging to hanging. Pedicels 12–15mm, slender, scaly. Calyx membranous, with 5 broadly triangular lobes 0.5–1mm. Corolla 25–30mm, tubular, slightly dilated near the mouth, bright red, glabrous inside; tube cylindrical, 17–20 x 3–4 x 5–7mm, slightly curved, laxly scaly outside, glabrous inside; lobes 6–7 x 4–6mm, half-spreading, broadly obovate, scaly proximally outside. Stamens almost equal in length, exserted to c.3mm; filaments linear, laxly hairy in the proximal ¼, glabrous distally; anthers obovate, c.1.5 x 1mm. Disc glabrous except for a minutely hairy upper margin. Ovary cylindrical-conical, densely covered with long white hairs and sub-densely scaly, c.5 x 1.5mm, tapering distally; style just shorter than the corolla tube with a few hairs at the base, glabrous distally; stigma club-shaped-globose.
