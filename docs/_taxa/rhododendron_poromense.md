Shrub to 1m. Twigs 1.5–2.5mm in diameter, very laxly covered with appressed scales, quickly glabrescent; internodes 4–9cm. Leaves 3–6 together in pseudowhorls. Blade 65–110 x 29–46mm, obovate- to elliptic; apex shortly acuminate or obtuse; margin narrowly revolute; base acutely tapering, glabrescent but densely blackish punctate above when mature, laxly appressed-scaly beneath. Scales minute, marginal zone narrow, irregularly lobed; centre slightly impressed, becoming glabrescent beneath also. Mid-vein flat, slightly, or not raised above, obtuse and much more prominent proximally beneath; lateral veins 7–9 per side, narrow and sub-parallel, curved-ascending and obscurely anastomosing along the margin, slightly raised on both sides, reticulation obscure. Petiole 7–9 x c.2mm, grooved above, rounded, scaly. Inflorescence 5–6-flowered. Pedicels c.15mm, thick, densely scaly, without hairs. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, obliquely disc-shaped, crenulate or obtusely lobed, scaly outside. Corolla c.40mm, funnel-shaped, red; tube c.20 x 4 x 6–8mm, sulcate at the base, sparsely, sub-stellately scaly outside, finely hairy in the proximal ½ inside; lobes 18–20 x 14–16mm, obovate-spathulate, often retuse, spreading. Stamens exserted; filaments linear, laxly hairy in the proximal ½, glabrous distally; anthers c.4 x 1mm, oblong, base obtuse. Disc low, glabrous. Ovary c.5 x 2mm, sub-cylindrical, tapering distally, finely shortly hairy, and sub-densely covered with minute, sub-entire scales; style 17–20mm, glabrous; stigma thick, globose.
