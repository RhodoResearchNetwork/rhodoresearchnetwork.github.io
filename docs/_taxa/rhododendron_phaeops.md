## Description
Shrub to 1m. Twigs 2–3mm in diameter, rounded, the tips stellate-scaly, later densely minutely warty and rough to the touch after the scales have gone; internodes 3–6cm. Leaves 3–4 together in pseudowhorls. Blade 50–80 x 30–50mm, broadly elliptic or ovate-elliptic; apex shortly tapering, obtuse; margin shortly revolute; base very broadly tapering to nearly rounded; stellate-scaly initially on both sides. Scales small, fragile, dendroid, each on top of a persistent epidermal tubercle, quickly becoming glabrescent but rough with the tubercles on both sides especially beneath. Mid-vein as thick as the petiole, above prominent and grooved along the midline in its proximal 2⁄3, impressed distally; lateral veins 6–8 per side, irregular, straight below, obscurely curved-anastomosing before the margin, very slightly impressed above, prominent beneath. Petiole 10–15 x c.2mm, grooved above, densely scaly. Inflorescence of 2–3 flowers. Pedicels 15–20 x c.1mm, densely brown-stellate-scaly. Calyx 5–6mm in diameter, disc-shaped, densely scaly, without hairs, with 5 distinct, irregular, elongate-triangular sub-acute teeth, which are white-ciliate and spreading to 2–4mm. Corolla 55–60mm, zygomorphic, tubular below, gradually widened upwards, red; tube c.50 x 6 x 15mm, curved, densely brown stellate-scaly outside, with white long retrorse hairs inside; lobes 15–20 x 12–15mm, broadly spathulate to sub-circular, scaly outside except near the margins, glabrous inside. Stamens unequal; filaments 45–55mm, linear, wider and densely patently hairy proximally, narrower and glabrescent to glabrous distally; anthers 5–5.5 x c.2mm, brown, broadly oblong. Disc glabrous. Ovary c.7 x 3mm, obconical-cylindrical, densely covered with sub-appressed, yellowish, stiff hairs which cover the scales, abruptly contracted distally; style thick, densely hairy and laxly scaly below, more laxly patently hairy but more densely scaly distally, glabrous at the upper 5mm below the globose stigma.
