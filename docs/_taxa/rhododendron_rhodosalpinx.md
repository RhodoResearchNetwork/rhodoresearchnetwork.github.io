## Description
Shrub. Twigs slender, c.2mm in diameter, tips densely scaly; internodes 1–4cm. Leaves 3–4 together in pseudo­whorls at the upper nodes. Blade 30–50 x 15–26mm, elliptic or sub-obovate-elliptic; apex broadly tapering and blunt, or almost rounded, sometimes slightly retuse; distinctly revolute at the margin; base broadly tapering, glabrescent with age above, sub-densely scaly beneath. Scales small, marginal zone sub-stellately lobed; centre minute, deeply impressed. Mid-vein very narrowly impressed above, as thick as the petiole and strongly prominent below, gradually decreasing distally beneath; lateral veins c.3 per side, a little raised beneath only, or often inconspicuous, without visible reticulation. Petiole 4–6 x 1mm, grooved above, slightly flattened, scaly. Bracteoles linear, c.10mm. Inflorescence 3-flowered. Pedicels 17–21 x c.0.8mm, sub-densely scaly, minutely patently hairy. Calyx c.2.5mm in diameter, sub-obliquely disc-shaped, very shortly and irregularly 5-lobed, scaly outside. Corolla trumpet-shaped, apparently red; tube 30–35 x 3–4 x 5–7mm, straight, sub-densely sub-stellately scaly outside, laxly hairy proximally inside; lobes 10–12 x c.8mm, obovate, spreading, scaly outside proximally. Stamens equalling or slightly exserted from the mouth of the corolla; filaments narrowly linear, patently laxly hairy in the proximal ½, glabrous distally; anthers 2.5 x 1mm, narrowly oblong, base obtuse. Disc glabrous. Ovary c.6 x 1.7mm, sub-cylindrical, densely covered with scales, which touch or even overlap each other (and possibly hide some short hairs), gradually tapering distally; style slender, as long as the corolla, scaly in the proximal 1⁄3 and laxly patently short-hairy in the proximal 2/3, glabrous distally; stigma globose, shortly 5-lobed.
