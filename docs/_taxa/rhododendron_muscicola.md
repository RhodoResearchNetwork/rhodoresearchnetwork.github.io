## Description
Spreading shrub to 10cm. Twigs 1–1.5mm in diameter, rounded, the youngest parts densely covered with stellate scales on stalks and with occasional hairs, older parts warty with the scale stalks; internodes 1–6cm. Leaves 5–7 together in well-marked pseudowhorls. Blade 6–12 x 3–8mm, narrowly to broadly elliptic, sometimes obovate; apex shortly acuminate, sub-acute to obtuse, or rounded; margin flat, entire or minutely crenulate; base tapering; laxly scaly and quickly glabrescent above, laxly and more persistently scaly below. Scales variably sized, rounded to stellate, impressed. Mid-vein impressed above and slightly raised below or obscure; lateral veins mostly obscure, sometimes with one at an acute angle. Petiole 1.5–2 x 1mm, grooved above, scaly with minute scales and occasional short hairs. Flower buds to 8 x 4mm, green becoming brown before opening, smooth with all bracts appressed. Bracts to 8 x 3.5mm, broadly ovate to broadly elliptic, covered with semi-appressed hairs outside and a few scales near the centre line distally and on the margin near the apex. Bracteoles c.8mm, filiform, with a few scales near the apex. Flowers solitary, rarely in pairs, hanging vertically. Pedicels 8–10 x 0.8mm, red, densely scaly with stalked scales and a few hairs. Calyx c.2.5mm in diameter, obliquely cup-shaped, 5-lobed, densely scaly. Corolla 25–28 x 18mm, dark red, without scent, narrowly funnel-shaped; tube 20–22 x 3–4 x 6–8mm, weakly curved, laxly silvery scaly outside, glabrous inside; lobes c.6 x 6mm, circular, overlapping to 1⁄3. Stamens loosely clustered on the lower side of the mouth, exserted to c.2mm; filaments linear, red, glabrous; anthers of two sizes, c.0.8 x 0.6mm and c.1.4 x 0.9mm. Disc with some hairs and scales at the upper margin. Ovary c.5 x 2mm, oblong-conical, longitudinally 5-grooved, densely silvery, stellate-scaly, gradually tapering distally; style c.8mm on opening, elongating to 15mm as the flower ages, with some sparse, spreading, yellowish hairs or scales at the base, elsewhere glabrous, or glabrous all over; stigma minute, c.1mm in diameter. Fruit 25 x 4mm, fusiform, curved, outer layer peeling away and the valves curling back. Seeds 6–7.5mm, without tails c.0.7mm, the longest tail 3.5mm, tails laxly crimped.
