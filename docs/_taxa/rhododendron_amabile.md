## Description
Shrub. Twigs rounded and densely scaly becoming glabrescent; internodes 2.5–9cm. Leaves 4 together in pseudowhorls, sub-sessile. Blade 25–60 x 12–28mm, broadly elliptic to elliptic; apex broadly tapering, sub-obtuse; margin slightly revolute; base sub-truncate, rounded to sub-cordate; at first scaly becoming glabrescent above, persistently and laxly scaly beneath. Scales irregularly dentate at margin, flat, each on top of a minute epidermal tubercle. Mid-vein flat or weakly impressed above, thick and very prominent beneath in the proximal 2/3, less so distally; lateral veins 7–8 per side, straight below, curved-anastomosing near the margin, hardly visible above, somewhat raised beneath, reticulation inconspicuous. Petiole 2–3 x c.1.5mm, scaly. Bracts to 14 x 9mm, ovate-acuminate, acute, outer ones scaly and sub-densely covered with hairs outside, inner ones hairy only. Bracteoles to 10 x 1mm, linear to sub-spathulate-linear, laxly hairy. Inflorescence 7–9-flowered. Pedicels 7–12 x c.0.5mm, densely scaly and shortly sub-patently greyish hairy. Calyx c.2.5mm in diameter, minute, membranous, wavy, irregularly fringed. Corolla trumpet-shaped, proximally white, pink-coloured distally; tube 30–33 x 2.5 x 3.5mm, cylindrical, straight, distinctly pouched at the base, laxly short-hairy and scaly outside, the scales completely disappearing by maturity, shortly hairy in the proximal ½ inside, glabrous distally; lobes 10–12 x 7–8mm, slightly spreading, obovate-spathulate, hairy outside at the base, otherwise glabrous, though distinctly ciliate. Stamens slightly exserted; filaments linear, hairy in the proximal 1⁄3, glabrous distally; anthers 1.8–2 x 0.7mm, oblong, base obtuse. Disc prominently 10-lobed, glabrous. Ovary 6–7 x 1.6mm, sub-cylindrical, densely hairy and scaly, abruptly narrowed distally; style hairy and scaly to nearly the top; stigma thick, conical-globose, just below the mouth.
