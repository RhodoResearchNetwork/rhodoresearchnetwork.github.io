## Description
Apparently small shrub. Twigs 4–8mm in diameter, rounded, with lax sub-stellate, appressed scales when young, becoming glabrescent, smooth, and pale; internodes 5–17cm. Leaves 5–8 together in pseudowhorls, sub-sessile. Blade 100–160 x 40–60mm, elliptic to ovate-elliptic, apex gradually long-acuminate (2–3cm), acute, or nearly so; margin slightly revolute; base broadly tapering, extreme base sub-truncate, glabrescent at maturity, but remaining blackish punctate above; laxly and more persistently scaly beneath but eventually glabrescent and punctate beneath too. Scales small, marginal zone irregu­larly sub-stellately lobed; centre minutely impressed. Mid-vein 2–4mm wide, obtusely prominent on both sides proximally; lateral veins 10–12 per side, obliquely ascending, faintly interarching before the margin, little raised on both sides, sometimes hardly visible, reticulation obscure. Petiole 0–2 x 2–4mm, flattened. Flower buds 30–35 x 10–15mm, ovoid-acuminate. Bracts to 30 x 10mm; outer bracts ovate, acuminate, inner ones oblong-ovate, all sub-acute, glabrous outside, margin initially scaly. Bracteoles to 25 x 0.5mm, filiform, glabrous. Inflorescence 4–6-flowered. Pedicels 20–30mm, laxly scaly. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, oblique, disc-shaped, obscurely lobed, sub-glabrous. Corolla 50–65mm, funnel-shaped, red or orange; tube 30–35 x 5–6 x 15–20mm, lobed at the base, sub-cylindrical near the base, gradually widened distally, glabrous outside, densely shortly white-hairy in the proximal ½ inside; lobes 20–30 x 15–20mm, obovate spathulate. Stamens unequal, the longest nearly as long as the corolla; filaments linear and densely sub-patently white-hairy proximally, filiform and glabrous distally; anthers c.4 x 1mm, oblong, base obtuse. Disc prominent, glabrous. Ovary c.10 x 2.5mm, sub-cylindrical, glabrous or very laxly scaly, tapering distally; style nearly as long as the corolla tube, glabrous; stigma rounded. Fruit 40–60 x 6–7mm, sub-fusiform, red, slightly curved, glabrous.
