## Description
Prostrate or low shrub (usually less than 20cm high), much branched, deciduous or evergreen, the dry bud-scales ± persistent. Leafy shoots from separate buds below the inflorescences; leaves ± sessile, obovate or spathulate, 10-60 x 4-22 mm, base cuneate, apex rounded with a glandular apiculum, serrulate, with marginal cilia and pubescent on the veins below, reticulation of veins evident. Inflorescence buds terminal, opening to produce a 1-3-flowered raceme, the peduncle bearing leafy bracts, often with glandular hairs as well as cilia. Calyx lobes oblong, 8-18 X 4-5 mm, obtuse, margins and back with cilia and glandular hairs. Corolla rose-purple (rarely white) with darker spots, ± rotate, pubescent outside or glabrous, c.20-25 mm long, tube c.7 mm long, the division between the lower pairs of lobes reaching to the base of the tube. Stamens 10, unequal in length, the largest ± equalling the corolla; filaments hairy below. Ovary ovoid, c.6 mm long, pubescent, 5-locular; style curved, pubescent near the base. Capsule ovoid, c.lOmm long, pubescent. ** * Rhododendron camtschaticum * var. * camschaticum * ** Foliage on vegetative shoots without glandular hairs (or these very sparse); corolla lobes pubescent on the outside and with ciliate margins. ** * Rhododendron camtschaticum * var. * glandulosum * ** A lower growing plant with narrower corolla lobes. The leaves of the vegetative shoots are distinctly glandular-hairy and the outer surface of the corolla lobes is glabrous (or virtually so) and margins are not ciliate.
