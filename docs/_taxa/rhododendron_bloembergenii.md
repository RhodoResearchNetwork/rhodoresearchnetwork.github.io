## Description
Tree to c.3m. Twigs 4–9mm in diameter, sub-angular, sparsely appressed-scaly when young, becoming glabrescent and often whitish; internodes 5–20cm. Leaves 2–3 together in loose pseudowhorls with additional leaves on the internode. Blade 90–190 x 30–48mm, broadly elliptic; apex shortly and abruptly acuminate, sub-acute; margin narrowly revolute when dry; base broadly tapering, often unequal; sparsely scaly to glabrescent above, sub-persistently laxly to sub-densely scaly beneath. Scales minute, flat, the broad marginal zone irregularly sub- stellately lobed and breaking up early; centre small, hardly impressed. Mid-vein as wide as the petiole proximally, flat or shallowly impressed above, thick and obtusely prominent beneath; lateral veins 9–12 per side, high- ascending, at an acute angle, curved and anastomosing before the margin, with several intermediate smaller veins, all parallel, faintly impressed or raised above, distinctly prominent beneath, reticulation slightly raised beneath only. Petiole 10–20 x c.3mm, flattened, scaly, striate lengthwise. Bracts to 60 x 25mm, outer bracts 15–20 x 10mm, ovate, obtuse, initially hairy outside especially at the base, later glabrescent, distinctly rough to the touch, inner bracts elliptic to spathulate, very densely hairy outside. Bracteoles c.20 x 1–1.5mm, linear to sub-spathulate, densely hairy. Inflorescence c.10-flowered in a complete umbel. Pedicels 12–17 x 1.5mm, sub-densely sub-stellate-scaly. Calyx c.3mm in diameter, disc-like, short. Corolla 65–75mm, tubular below, expanded distally, white, scented; tube 45–50 x 5–6 x 6–7mm, cylindrical, straight, the base lobed, glabrous outside, densely shortly hairy inside; lobes 20–25 x 15–20mm, broadly obovate-spathulate or sub- circular. Stamens exserted to c.10mm; filaments linear and densely patently hairy in the proximal 2⁄3, glabrous and filiform distally; anthers 6–7 x 1.5mm, oblong, each cell contracted into a short basal apiculus. Disc prominent, glabrous. Ovary 9–10 x 3–4mm, sub-cylindrical, yellowish hairy (scales not visible), tapering distally; style thick, slightly exceeding the stamens, densely hairy proximally, sub-densely or laxly so and minutely scaly distally, glabrous for the terminal 6–8mm; stigma c.3mm in diameter, thick-knob-like. Fruit 35–40 x 7–8mm, thickly fusiform-cylindric, laxly shortly hairy, somewhat rugose, slightly curved.
