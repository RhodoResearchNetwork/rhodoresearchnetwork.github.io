## Description
Shrub to 2m. Twigs slender, rounded, densely brown-scaly; internodes 1.5–6cm. Leaves 3–7 together in loose pseudowhorls or spirally arranged. Blade 18–30 x 4–7mm, linear to narrowly elliptic, gradually tapering in the distal 1⁄3, the extreme apex obtuse; margin flat or revolute in dry specimens slightly irregular; base broadly tapering to rounded, silvery scaly but quickly glabrescent above, the surface then green; densely brown-scaly beneath. Scales large, of a more uniform size than is typical of species in this section; although larger ones are present, the majority are spaced about one diameter apart with relatively few overlapping. Mid-vein strongly impressed above, slightly prominent beneath (more so in dry specimens); lateral veins obscure. Petiole 2–4 x 1mm, grooved above, densely scaly. Flower buds 7–15 x 4–6mm, ovoid; apex obtuse, bracts all closely appressed. Outer bracts narrowly ovate, inner ones obovate to sub-spathulate, with a broad triangular area of dense brown scales in the centre outside and with green, glabrous marginal areas, margins white ciliate. Bracteoles narrowly linear, ciliate at the top, to 12mm. Inflorescence of 2–6 flowers in an open umbel, the flowers held horizontally to half-hanging. Pedicels 8–10 x 1mm, covered with brown scales. Calyx c.2mm in diameter, small, oblique, disc-shaped, obscurely lobed, densely scaly. Corolla 22 x 27mm, bright yellow but with prominent orange-brown spots from the large scales outside; tube c.10 x 5 x 11mm, but constricted in the middle to 4mm where it is longitudinally fluted, covered in prominent brown scales outside, glabrous inside, straight; lobes 15 x 11mm, brown scaly outside in a broad roughly triangular area from the tube and tapering distally, spreading to c.45°, the upper lobes overlapping to 1⁄3, the two lower, not overlapping. Stamens loosely and irregularly arranged all round the flower, or on the lower side; filaments pale yellow, filiform above, dilated towards the base, densely white-patent-hairy in the proximal 3mm; anthers brown, exserted to c.10mm, c.3 x 0.5mm, cells pointed at the base. Disc thick, glabrous. Ovary 4–5 x 1.5–2mm, sub-cylindrical, densely scaly, gradually tapering distally; style thick, translucent pale yellow and almost as long as the corolla, scaly in the proximal ½, glabrous distally; stigma thick, pale yellow, curved to the lower side of the flower, 5-lobed. Fruit 15–25 x 3–3.5mm, cylindrical, densely brown-scaly; valves reflexing back against the pedicel and often twisting; placentae splaying out and often breaking away from the base. Seeds 58–63mm, without tails 0.9–1mm, the longest tail 25–27mm, the tails very slender, filiform, sometimes crimped.
