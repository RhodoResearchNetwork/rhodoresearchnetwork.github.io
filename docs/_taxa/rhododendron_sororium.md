Mid-vein distinct, impressed above and raised below; lateral veins 2–3 per side, curved, impressed above, slightly raised beneath. Petiole 3–5 x 1.5–2mm, flattened. Bracts to 10 x 5mm, the outer shortly ovate and obtuse, long-hairy outside, with the margin densely white ciliate; the inner narrowly ovate with longer sub- acuminate apices. Inflorescence of solitary flowers or rarely in pairs. Pedicels densely scaly, without simple hairs, at flowering 15–20mm. Calyx c.3mm in diameter, oblique, with obtuse lobes to 1mm, frequently indistinct. Corolla c.14mm long, colour not recorded but presumably yellow, tubular-campanulate; tube c.8 x 4mm, shortly cylindrical, outside densely scaly, inside white-hairy; lobes 6–7 x c.4mm, spreading, obovate, outside laxly scaly, inside glabrous. Stamens dimorphic, 8 and 10mm long; filaments linear, flattened, at the base glabrous, in the middle part white-hairy, the upper part glabrous; anthers c.3 x 0.7mm. Disc glabrous. Ovary c.5 x 2.5mm, conical, strongly contracted distally, densely scaly; style columnar, club-shaped above, glabrous; stigma truncate, rounded.
