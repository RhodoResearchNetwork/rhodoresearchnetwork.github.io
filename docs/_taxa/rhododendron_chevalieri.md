## Description
Shrub to 2m. Twigs 2–2.5mm in diameter, smooth, rounded and at first densely brown scaly; internodes 3–5mm. Leaves in moderately tight pseudowhorls, 4–5 together, apparently rigidly held semi-erect. Blade 40–50 x 13–24mm, elliptic to narrowly obovate, very shortly acuminate to a broadly acute or obtuse apex; margin entire, flat to slightly revolute distally distinctly revolute in the proximal 1⁄3, especially when dry; base tapering and decurrent, glabrescent above, densely scaly beneath. Scales rounded, with a moderately large centre but broad, paler flange, lightly impressed. Mid-vein narrowly impressed above in the proximal ½–2⁄3, then flat; narrowly raised beneath throughout its length, sometimes terminating in an indistinct terminal gland. Petiole 4–10 x c.2mm, weakly grooved above, densely brown-scaly, often flushed pink. Bracts to 20 x 8mm, ovate, acute, with a few brown scales outside distally and along the margins, glabrous inside. Bracteoles 6 x 1mm, narrowly triangular, with a few teeth on the margin, glabrous. Inflorescence 1–4-flowered, the flowers held semi-erect. Pedicels 8–10 x 1–1.5mm, densely scaly, without simple hairs. Corolla 20–23 x 35–49mm, bright to pale yellow, without scent; tube 6–12 x 4–5 x 10–12mm, glabrous outside; lobes 15 x 12mm, half-spreading. Stamens spreading round the mouth of the flower, exserted to 7mm; filaments glabrous or with a few hairs at the base; anthers c.4 x 2mm. Disc glabrous. Ovary 5 x 25mm, with patent white hairs and brown scales; style 6 x 1mm, glabrous, bent to the lower side of the tube. Fruit 15–18 x 5–6mm, erect, prominently hairy and scaly.
