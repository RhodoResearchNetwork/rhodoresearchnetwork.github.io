## Description
Shrubs to 2 m, often flowering precociously. Young growth lepidote and variably loriform-setose with straight or curved setae. Leaves ± deciduous, flat, mostly ± obovate, more rarely obovate-elliptic, 25-45(-65) x 14-21 (-27) mm, ± rounded at the apex, cuneate at the base, petiole loriform-setose; lower surface variably loriform-setose, usually with at least some setae on the base of the midrib and on margins, the setae straight or slightly curved; scales very unequal, dense, the larger c. 2 x the diameter of the smaller, the smaller usually rapidly becoming greyish, purple or almost black; upper surface puberulent at least along the midrib, rarely lepidote. Inflorescence 2-4-flowered, pedicels (11-) 15-22 mm, variably lepidote, usually loriform-setose, at least towards the base. Calyx usually obscurely lobed, lobes up to 2-5 mm, rarely one lobe considerably longer (up to 7 mm), lepidote, loriform-ciliate or glabrous. Corolla yellow to greenish yellow, sometimes flushed with red, 17-23 mm, tube 8-11 mm, lepidote and glabrous outside. Ovary lepidote, style sometimes puberulent at base. Capsule lepidote, cylindric, 9-11 mm. ** * Rhododendron mekongense * var. * longipilosum * ** Leaves loriform-setose over the whole upper surface ** * Rhododendron mekongense * var. * mekongense * ** Leaves without loriform setae on the upper surface. Loriform setae more widespread, present on at least some of the following: lower leaf surface, pedicels and calyx lobes, as well as on petioles and leaf margins. Calyx loriform-ciliate; pedicels usually loriform-setose over their whole length. ** * Rhododendron mekongense * var. * melinanthum * ** Leaves without loriform setae on the upper surface. Loriform setae more widespread, present on at least some of the following: lower leaf surface, pedicels and calyx lobes, as well as on petioles and leaf margins. Calyx glabrous; pedicels not setose, or setose only at the base. ** * Rhododendron mekongense * var. * rubrolineatum * ** Leaves without loriform setae on the upper surface. Loriform setae very sparse, restricted to petioles and leaf margins and sometimes at the base of the midrib beneath.
