## Description
Shrub to 2.5m. Twigs 4–6mm in diameter, round, green, laxly scaly; internodes 4–10cm. Leaves 3–5 together in loose pseudowhorls. Blade 80–160 x 35–60mm, elliptic; apex shortly acuminate, narrowly to broadly acute, rarely obtuse; margin entire, flat or weakly revolute; base narrowly tapering, sometimes a little decurrent; minutely silvery scaly above at first, the scales leaving small impressed pits, laxly to sub-densely and more persistently scaly beneath. Scales irregularly lobed in the marginal zone; centre dark, shallowly impressed. Mid-vein strongly raised above proximally, gradually tapering distally becoming smooth or even slightly impressed in the distal ½, beneath broadly and shallowly raised; lateral veins 8–10 per side, curved-spreading and obscurely interarching at some distance from the margin, slightly prominent on both sides or obscure, reticulation obscure, or faintly visible beneath only. Petiole 10–25 x 3–4mm, without a groove, laxly, minutely scaly. Flower buds to 35 x 20mm, ovoid, acuminate. Bracts to 25 x 13mm, outer bracts ovate-acuminate, sub-acute, initially laxly scaly outside, but quickly glabrescent, inner ones ovate-elliptic, obtuse, glabrous. Bracteoles to 20 x 2mm, linear proximally, sub-spathulate distally, glabrous. Inflorescence 5–12-flowered, a complete or slightly open umbel. Pedicels 20–45 x c.1mm, laxly scaly, glabrescent. Calyx 3–4mm in diameter, oblique, disc-shaped or rim-like, obscurely lobed or wavy, with a few scales outside. Corolla 30–35 x 30–35mm, funnel-shaped, yellow often flushed with orange or red; tube c.15 x 5–6 x 10–15mm, pouched at the base, glabrous inside and out; lobes 13–18 x 10–15mm, spreading, broadly elliptic-obovate. Stamens 20–25mm, exserted to c.10mm, unequal, irregularly arranged around the flower; filaments linear, glabrous; anthers 3–3.5 x 1–1.3mm, oblong, a little curved, base obtuse. Disc prominent, glabrous. Ovary 5–6 x 2–2.5mm, ovoid-conical, initially with some fragile sub-stellate scales, or glabrous, often minutely warty, abruptly contracted distally; style 10–15mm, slender, glabrous; stigma 2–3mm in diameter, knob-like, thickly 5-lobed. Fruit c.30 x 6mm, fusiform, somewhat oblique and curved, glabrous.
