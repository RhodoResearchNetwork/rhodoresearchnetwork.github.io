## Description
Shrub to 3m. Twigs 2–3mm in diameter, rounded, laxly stellate-scaly, early glabrescent and smooth; internodes 4–8cm. Leaves in loose pseudowhorls in the upper ½ of the internodes. Blade 25–40 x 12–20mm, elliptic or ovate-elliptic, more rarely sub-obovate; apex shortly and broadly sub-acuminate, or almost rounded, with a faint apical gland; margin pale, cartilaginous, entire or weakly crenulate with impressed scales; base broadly tapering or rounded, sometimes sub-truncate or sub-cordate, sub-densely scaly above but quickly glabrescent, sub-densely and persistently scaly below. Scales sub-stellate or obtusely lobed, marginal zone wide; centre minute, slightly impressed. Mid-vein broad proximally, impressed above, prominent in the lower ½ beneath, becoming hardly visible towards the apex of the blade; lateral veins c.5 per side, spreading, slightly conspicuous above only. Petiole 1.5–3 x 1–1.5mm. Outer bracts to 18 x 7mm, ovate, sub-acuminate or obtuse, inner ones ovate-oblong to sub-spathulate, all hairy outside and fringed with scales. Bracteoles to 15mm, linear, laxly hairy. Inflorescence a 3–4-flowered open umbel. Flowers hanging. Pedicels 15–20 x 1mm, slender, densely covered with reddish-brown sub-­stellate scales and very short white hairs. Calyx c.2.5mm in diameter, oblique, disc-shaped, margin obscurely lobed, scaly and very shortly hairy. Corolla 25–32 x 15–20mm, tubular, red, glabrous outside and in; tube 20–25 x c.4 x 6–7mm, cylindrical, straight, the base 5-pouched; lobes 7–9 x 7–9mm, spreading, obovate-spathulate or nearly circular. Stamens unequal, the longest nearly as long as the corolla; filaments linear, glabrous; anthers 2.7 x 1mm, oblongoid; bases sometimes shortly appendaged. Disc prominent, glabrous. Ovary c.4 x 2.5mm, thick, sub-ovoid to con­ical, densely covered with short, sub-patent white hairs and with scales between the hairs, abruptly contracted distally; style slender, glabrous, as long as the stamens; stigma sub-globose. Fruit 20–28 x c.5mm, sub-cylindrical, tapering at both ends, sub-densely hairy and laxly scaly.
