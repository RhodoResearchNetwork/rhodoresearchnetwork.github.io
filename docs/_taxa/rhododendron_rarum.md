## Description
Slender much-branched shrub to 1.5m. Twigs 1–2mm in diameter, rounded, tips densely brown-scaly, older parts glabrescent, somewhat rough; internodes 2–10cm. Leaves 2–5 together in pseudowhorls, often very different in size in the same whorl, with some very reduced leaves between them. Blade 25–60 x 6–15mm, narrowly elliptic to narrowly ovate-elliptic, usually broadest in the proximal 1⁄3; apex gradually long-acuminate, acute but often with the extreme point obtuse or rounded; margin entire or weakly and irregularly sinuate, flat when fresh or slightly revolute especially near the base when dry; base rounded or broadly tapering; with sparse silvery scales above and sparse brown scales below, quickly glabrescent above, more persistently scaly beneath but eventually also glabrescent there, old leaves a little rough to the touch on both sides. Scales deeply stellately divided, dendroid, each on top of a minute, persistent, epidermal tubercle. Mid-vein impressed above and prominent beneath; lateral veins obscure. Petiole 2–4 x 0.75–1mm, slender, minutely grooved above and densely scaly. Flower buds to 12 x 7mm, ovoid, acute. Bracts to 10 x 6mm; outer bracts with spreading tips or these sometimes incurved, subulate, densely scaly outside; inner bracts broadly ovate, abruptly subulate, densely brown scaly outside in a broad stripe which expands distally, all bracts marginally scaly and glabrous inside. Bracteoles to 10mm, linear to filiform, scaly in the distal ½. Inflorescence of solitary or paired flowers, rarely more in the wild, although the close proximity of flower buds can give the appearance of 3–4-flowered umbels. Flowers hanging or half-hanging. Pedicels 7–10 x c.1mm, densely stellately scaly. Calyx c.2mm in diameter, small, disc-like, not or very shortly obtusely lobed, scaly. Corolla 25–35 x 20–25mm, pink to dark red, distinctly zygomorphic; tube 20–28 x 4–6 x 8–9mm, curved, densely stellately scaly and without hairs outside, glabrous or very laxly hairy inside; lobes 8–12 x 8–13mm, broadly obovate to sub-circular. Stamens clustered on the upper side of the corolla, slightly un­equal, exserted to c.7mm; filaments narrowly linear, pink to red, glabrous proximally, laxly patently hairy in the middle, glabrous distally; anthers c.2 x 1mm, oblong, brown to purplish-black. Disc glabrous or scaly on the upper margin. Ovary c.6 x 2–2.5mm, sub-cylindrical, densely stellately scaly, gradually tapering distally; style held on the upper side of the tube, pink, scaly in the proximal 1–2mm and with semi-appressed distally pointing hairs to within 1–2mm of the apex; stigma remaining well short of the mouth of the flower even when receptive, club-shaped, purple. Fruit 30–40 x 4–5mm, narrowly oblong, the valves curving back and often twisting, the placentae breaking away from the base of the column and curving outwards. Seeds c.4mm including the tails.
