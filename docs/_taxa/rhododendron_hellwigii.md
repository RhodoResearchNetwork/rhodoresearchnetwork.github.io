## Description
Shrub or small tree. Twigs 4–6mm in diameter, at first densely brown, stellate-scaly, quickly glabrescent, rounded, or slightly angular; internodes 2–12cm. Leaves 3–5 together in pseudowhorls, or sometimes with 2 or 3 more loosely arranged. Blade 80–160 x 50–100mm, ovate to ovate-elliptic, sometimes sub-circular; apex obtuse to rounded; margin entire and flat; base rounded to cordate; brown with stellate scales on both sides initially quickly glabrescent both above and below. Scales small, irregularly lobed, sessile or very shortly stalked, each on top of a minute epidermal tubercle which remains visible for a long time beneath. Mid-vein grooved above in the proximal ½ and somewhat impressed distally, below strongly raised throughout its length; lateral veins 8–10 per side, irregular, the lowest 2 from near the base of the blade, all straight below, curved-anastomosing to the margin, smooth to slightly prominent on both sides, veins coarse, much less visible, reticulation obscure. Petiole 10–20 x 3–4mm, robust, a little flattened, not or only faintly grooved above, densely brown-scaly. Flower buds to 60 x 35mm, ovoid, dark purple, the bracts all tightly appressed, rough with short white hairs outside. Outer bracts ovate to sub-circular, inner ones broadly spathulate, obtuse or very shortly apiculate, densely covered with short, thick hairs on both sides, glabrescent but remaining rough, fringed with scales. Bract­eoles c.20–35 x 1–4mm, linear to sub-spathulate, hairy below, glabrous distally. Inflorescence an open umbel of 2–6 flowers, held horizontally or slightly hanging. Pedicels 6–15 x 3–5mm, densely dark-brown scaly. Calyx c.6mm in diameter, rim-like, very shortly obtusely 5–6-lobed. Corolla 65–90 x 50–60mm, broadly funnel-shaped, dark blood-red, fleshy; tube 40–55 x 10–15 x 17–23mm, slightly dilated upwards, curved upwards and longitudinally channelled, glabrous outside, densely covered with short retrorse hairs inside in the proximal ½, lobes c.31 x 30–35mm, 6–7, spreading to the perpendicular, broadly spathulate or obovate, overlapping to ¾. Stamens 12–14, clustered on the lower side of the mouth of the flower, exserted to 12mm; filaments pink, linear, (1mm wide), with retrorse or patent hairs in their proximal 2⁄3, glabrous and filiform distally; anthers 7–8 x c.1.5mm, dark purple, linear-oblong, the base of each cell shortly obtusely bilobed. Disc glabrous, purple. Ovary c.10 x 4–5mm, sub-ovoid-cylindrical, densely covered with small flattened scales, abruptly tapering distally; style 30–40 x c.2mm, upwardly curved, presenting the stigma on the upper side of the mouth, thick, glabrous, sometimes shining; stigma shortly thick-globose, obscurely 5–6-lobed. Fruit c.30 x 18mm. Seeds 5–5.6mm, without tails c.1mm, longest tail to 2.5mm, one or both tails quite broad and often deeply crimped.
