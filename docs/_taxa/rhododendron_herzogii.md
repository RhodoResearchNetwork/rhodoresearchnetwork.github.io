## Description
Erect shrub to 2m. Twigs rounded, sub-densely scaly when young, glabrescent and whitish later; internodes 3–13cm. Leaves 4–6 together in tight pseudowhorls; aromatic with a pleasantly resinous smell when crushed. Blade 40–60 x 20–40mm, elliptic or obovate-elliptic; apex broadly obtusely acuminate, sometimes rounded; margin slightly revolute towards the base; base broadly tapering to almost rounded, sub-densely scaly when young, though early glabrescent above persistently impressed-scaly beneath. Scales rounded, pale yellow, their marginal zones narrow and shallowly irregularly crenate. Mid-vein slightly grooved above, robust and prominent beneath; lateral veins 6–10 (rarely up to 12) per side, slightly curved, parallel to each other, obscurely anastomosing, faintly impressed above, raised beneath, reticulation obscure. Petiole 4–10 x 1.5–2mm, semi-circular, grooved above, scaly, pink or green. Flower buds c.20 x 10mm, obovoid, pale green when fresh. Bracts to 15 x 10mm, ovate, thin, densely scaly outside except for a glabrous marginal area, with scales along the edges and some sparse short hairs on the outer side, the scales transparent-silvery in fresh specimens. Bract­eoles to 30mm, narrowly linear. Inflorescence a 5–10-flowered umbel of stiffly semi-erect flowers. Pedicels 4–8 x c.1.5mm, thick, densely scaly. Calyx very small, oblique, disc-shaped, sub-entire. Corolla 40–90mm, pure white, or slightly pinkish at the tube externally, fragrant, semi-erect, trumpet-shaped; tube 35–85 x 3–4 x 5–6mm, straight or slightly curved, densely scaly outside, densely hairy and sparingly or not scaly in the proximal part inside; lobes 8–9 x 5–6mm, spreading to somewhat reflexed, circular to elliptic-obovate, scaly outside, glabrous inside. Stamens exserted in a tight cluster beyond the recurved corolla lobes at first, later deflexed to lie against the lower lobes; filaments white, very slender, densely and patently hairy in the proximal 2⁄3 only; anthers orange, oblong. Disc very sparsely hairy or glabrous. Ovary 6–7 x 1.5mm, narrowly cylindrical, very densely scaly, abruptly tapering distally; style exserted from the mouth, densely scaly below, less so or glabrous distally; stigma green, shortly obconical. Fruit 30–50 x 4–5mm, reddish, cylindrical, straight, scaly.
