## Description
Erect shrub to 2.5m. Twigs spreading, rounded, tips sub-densely covered with flat sub-stellate scales, lower down glabrescent and smooth; internodes 2–10cm. Leaves in loose pseudowhorls, 3–5 together. Blade 60–120 x 23–44mm, narrowly elliptic to elliptic; apex shortly acuminate, sub-acute, rarely obtuse; margin narrow, cartilaginous and revolute; base broadly acutely tapering; initially scaly on both sides, glabrescent above, more persistently scaly beneath. Scales sub-dense, small, reddish-brown, the narrow marginal zone variously lobed or sub-stellate; centre dark, distinctly impressed, leaving black pits when the scales have gone. Mid-vein narrow and slightly impressed above, thick and obtusely prominent beneath; lateral veins 8–10 per side, spreading, anastomosing before the margin, faintly impressed above, slightly raised beneath, reticulation inconspicuous. Petiole 4–10 x 1.5–2mm, compressed and grooved above. Flower buds 18 x 8mm, ovoid, smooth, often lateral at the base of older inflorescences. Bracts to 17 x 11mm, ovate, inner ones obovate, obtuse or mostly apic­ulate, glabrous except for scales on the upper part of the outside and fragile marginal scales. Bracteoles 7–10 x 0.5–1mm, linear below, spathulate at the apex, glabrous. Inflorescence 3–9-flowered. Pedicels 20–25mm, slender, densely stellate-scaly, without hairs. Calyx c.3mm in diameter, obliquely round or cup-shaped, scaly outside, with unequal triangular teeth up to 3mm. Corolla 22–30mm, tubular, expanded at the lobes, scarlet; tube 15–22 x 4–5 x 7–8mm, sparsely scaly outside, hairy in the proximal ½ inside; lobes 9–13 x 6–10mm, obovate, sub-equal. Stamens as long as the corolla tube; filaments linear, sub-densely covered with long, patent hairs in the proximal 3–5mm, glabrous distally; anthers 1–1.5mm, obovate, apex truncate, base sub-acute. Disc prominent, glabrous. Ovary 5–7 x c.3mm, sub-cylindrical-conical, abruptly contracted distally, densely scaly, and with just a few scattered hairs, especially proximally between the scales; style thick, glabrous, nearly as long as the stamens; stigma rounded, with thick lobes. Fruit 20–23 x c.5mm, cylindrical, 5-­angular, densely scaly. Seeds c.6mm including the tails.
