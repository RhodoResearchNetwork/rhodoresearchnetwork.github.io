## Description
Shrub to 4m. Twigs 6–8mm in diameter, densely scaly; internodes 5–12cm. Leaves 4–6 together in tight pseudo­whorls. Blade 60–110 x 40–75mm, broadly elliptic or elliptic; apex obtuse to rounded; margin very narrowly cartilaginous, flat or minutely revolute; base broadly tapering to rounded occasionally sub-cordate; at first densely scaly above with fragile scales standing up on stalks, slightly less densely scaly below. Scales sub- circular, very variable in size, deeply impressed with large centres and narrow lobed margins. Mid-vein weakly raised above in the proximal ¼–1⁄3 but deeply grooved here also; broadly raised in the proximal ½–2⁄3 below; lateral veins 4–7 per side, spreading at c.45°, looping and joining before the margin, reticulation somewhat obscure above, distinct below. Petiole 7–20 x 3–4mm, weakly grooved in the distal part only, densely brown-scaly. Bracts to 50 x 30mm, sub-spathulate, obovate, densely scaly and shortly appressed hairy outside, inside shortly appressed hairy. Bracteoles to 40 x 5mm, linear proximally, spathulate distally, hairy. Inflorescence of 11–16 flowers in an open, flat, umbel; the flowers held horizontally. Pedicels 8–10 x 2–2.5mm, densely scaly and sparsely hairy distally. Corolla 80–125 × 40–55mm, trumpet-shaped, pink, scented; tube 65–75 × 4–5 x 10–14mm, straight, very sparsely scaly outside, densely retrorse-hairy inside; lobes c.25 × 25mm, sub-circular, sometimes slightly retuse, spreading and overlapping to c.½. Stamens exserted to 10mm, clustered in a group in the mouth; filaments densely hairy at the base, becoming less so and glabrous for the distal 1⁄3; anthers 3.5–4.5 × c.1.5mm. Disc prominent, densely hairy. Ovary 10–13 × 3–4mm, densely covered in appressed hairs which cover scales, tapering gradually distally; style densely hairy and scaly proximally, becoming less hairy distally, the central part entirely scaly, glabrous for the ultimate 15mm; stigma 4–5mm in diameter, disc-shaped. Fruit 55–80 x 7–9mm.
