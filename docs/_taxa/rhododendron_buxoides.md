## Description
Shrub to 2m. Twigs 2–3mm in diameter, scaly at first with stalked scales, warty with persistent scale bases after the scales have gone; internodes 0.5–1.5cm. Leaves in tight to loose pseudowhorls, 2–5 together or spirally arranged. Blade 10–30 x 4–14mm, broadly obovate to elliptic; apex obtuse, to rounded, often emarginate; margin strongly and broadly revolute, sometimes crenulate with impressed scales; base tapering, decurrent; densely and persistently scaly on both sides. Scales large, thick, rounded, entire, strongly impressed; the narrow margin tending to disintegrate, the centre persistent. Mid-vein impressed above, raised below; lateral veins 3–4 per side, obscure to strongly raised below at least when dry, reticulation obscure. Petiole 1.5–2mm. Bracts c.5mm, obovate, densely scaly and white-hairy distally outside and with a ciliate margin. Inflorescence 2–4 flowers in an open umbel, hanging vertically. Pedicels 6–14 x 0.5–0.6mm, slender, densely scaly, without hairs. Calyx obliquely disc-shaped, obscurely lobed or undulate, densely scaly. Corolla tubular, red; tube 13–15 x 3–4 x 4–7mm, completely very densely covered in thick rounded scales, glabrous inside; lobes 3–4 x 3–4mm, erect, obovate, spathulate, or sub-circular, scaly in the central part outside. Stamens exserted to c.3mm; filaments linear, glabrous; anthers 1.5 x 1mm, obovoid. Disc glabrous. Ovary c.2.5 x 1.5mm, conical, densely scaly, gradually tapering distally; style scaly at the base only, glabrous distally, about as long as the corolla; stigma slightly broadened, obliquely truncate. Fruit 7–9 x 3–4mm, shortly cylindrical, deeply grooved. Seed 1.2–1.5mm, without tails c.1mm, the longest tail to 0.4mm, mostly broadly triangular at one end with a short narrow tail at the other.
