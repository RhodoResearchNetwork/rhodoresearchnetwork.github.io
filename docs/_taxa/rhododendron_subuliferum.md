## Description
Shrub to 2m. Twigs 1–1.5mm in diameter, rounded, densely sub-stellate with shortly stalked scales, quickly glabrescent, leaving the surface warty with low scale bases; internodes 3–9cm. Leaves 3–6 together in tight pseudowhorls. Blade 25–45 x 10–23mm, obovate, more rarely elliptic; apex rounded or obtuse, sometimes minutely emarginate; margin entire or minutely crenulate, distinctly revolute in the proximal ½, hardly or not revolute distally; base tapering; glabrescent and densely rugulose above, densely scaly beneath. Scales with the thin marginal zone angular or obtusely sub-stellately lobed; centre persistent, thickened, reddish brown and slightly impressed. Mid-vein narrowly impressed above, prominent beneath but tapering gradually distally; lateral veins 1–3 per side, inconspicuous or obscure. Petiole 3–4 x 1–1.5mm, scaly, flattened. Flower buds to 10 x 4mm, with the outermost bract tips spreading, the inner ones erect. Bracts 10–15 x 5–6mm, ovate but with long subulate points, glabrous outside or with minute, almost papillose hairs and fra­gile scales along the margins, glabrous inside. Bracteoles c.10mm, filiform. Flowers in pairs or solitary, hanging vertically. Pedicels 10–18 x 0.75mm, densely covered with stellate, stalked scales and short hairs. Calyx c.3mm in diameter, oblique, very shortly irregularly 5-lobed, revolute, scaly and hairy outside, ciliate on the margin. Corolla 30–50 x 20–25mm, tubular, slightly expanded distally, dark-red, without scent; tube 30–35 x 4–5 x 8–13mm, weakly curved, laxly scaly or glabrous outside, glabrous inside; lobes 6–12 x 6–10mm, erect, or half-spreading, spathulate-obovate or sub-circular. Stamens unequal, exserted to 10mm; filaments linear, 1mm wide at the base, glabrous; anthers c.3 x 1mm, broadly oblong, cells obtuse or provided with an indistinct basal apiculus, very dark almost black. Disc prominent, glabrous or with hairs on the upper margin. Ovary 6–8 x c.2mm, sub-cylindrical, densely stellately scaly, gradually tapering distally; style glabrous, or with a few hairs at the base, as long as or slightly longer than the corolla; stigma rounded.
