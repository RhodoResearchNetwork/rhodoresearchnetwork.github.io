## Description
Shrub. Twigs c.4mm in diameter, rounded, red-brown, glabrous; the one known (upper) internode 10cm. Leaves 4 in a pseudowhorl. Blade 85–135 x 40–55mm, ovate to elliptic-ovate, gradually acuminate towards the sub-acute apex; margin a little revolute; base rounded to slightly cordate, or unequal, glabrescent above; sub-densely scaly beneath. Scales minute, irregularly sub-stellately lobed in the marginal zone; centre darker, slightly impressed. Mid-vein thick, striate lengthwise, a continuation of the thick petiole, obtusely and very prominent in the proximal part above, broad and flat beneath; lateral veins 12–15 per side, at an angle of nearly 90°, parallel, obscurely arching inwards before the margin, slightly impressed above, hardly raised beneath, reticulation lax, obscure on both sides. Petiole 4–6 x c.3mm, slightly flattened and grooved above, initially scaly. Inflorescence 9-flowered. Pedicels 20–27mm, strong, laxly or very laxly scaly, more densely so just below the calyx, not hairy. Calyx 4–5mm in diameter, disc-shaped, obscurely lobed or crenate, thick, glabrous. Corolla 25–27mm, funnel-shaped; tube 10–13 x c.5 x c.10mm, glabrous outside, densely shortly grey-hairy for the proximal 2⁄3 inside; lobes 13–15 x 10–13mm, elliptic-obovate. Stamens sub-equal, nearly as long as the corolla; filaments linear and densely sub-patently white-hairy in the proximal ½, filiform and glabrous distally; anthers 3.5 x 1.3mm, broad-oblong. Disc prominent, glabrous. Ovary 5–6 x c.2mm, sub-cylindrical, glabrous, tapering distally; style columnar, glabrous, c.6mm; stigma knob-like.
