## Description
Tree or shrub to 7m. Twigs 5–8mm in diameter, rounded, at first with a thick covering of reddish-brown stellate scales, quickly glabrescent; internodes 5–11cm. Leaves 5–7 together in well-marked pseudowhorls add­itionally with several very reduced leaves. Blade 70–150 x 40–90mm, elliptic or broadly elliptic; apex gradually broadly tapering or sub-acuminate, the extreme tip obtuse; margin entire and flat; base broadly tapering to rounded, or shortly cordate, sometimes ‘pinched’ into a vertical undulation; when young, densely scaly, at first the scales white but they quickly turn brown before falling off; becoming glabrescent above and often beneath also. Scales sub-dendroid, narrowly stellately divided to the minute centre, fragile, leaving no pits. Mid-vein c.2mm wide proximally, gradually narrower and slightly impressed distally; lateral veins 9–11 per side, slightly curved, often deeply forked, anastomosing before the margin, faintly though even distinctly impressed above, hardly raised or inconspicuous beneath, reticulation obscure. Petiole 20–40 x 4–5mm, grooved above, green but densely brown scaly. Flower buds to 16 x 15mm, spherical, or top-shaped, smooth with all except the outermost bracts fully appressed, green or pale brown. Outermost bracts subulate, densely brown scaly, other bracts with only a few scales outside, fringed with long-stalked brown scales along the margins, glabrous inside, sub-circular, rounded at the apex but often splitting to become emarginate. Bracteoles c.20mm, linear to filiform, glabrous. Inflorescence of 25–30 horizontal to semi-erect flowers in a full umbel. Pedicels 60–80 x 1.5–2mm, orange-red, scaly. Flowers brilliant pink, or orange with a yellow centre, very strongly scented. Calyx 4–5mm in diameter, oblique, circular, sometimes shortly and obtusely 5-lobed. Corolla 30–35 x 40–48mm; tube 18–20 x 5–7 x 13–20mm, funnel-shaped, strongly angled and slightly grooved proximally, with transparent scales outside and irregular hairs in the proximal ½ inside; lobes 18–20 x 15–18mm, broadly obovate-spathulate, slightly retuse, with scales in the central part outside, overlapping to c.½, spreading horizontally. Stamens irregularly arranged in two groups on either side of the flower; filaments 25mm, sub-densely to laxly hairy in the proximal 1⁄3, glabrous distally, yellow at the base, passing through pink to red distally; anthers 2.7–3 x c.1.2mm, pale-brown. Disc deeply lobed, hairy between the glabrous lobes. Ovary 5–6 x 3–4mm, green, with distally pointing hairs which cover scales; style green and hairy in the proximal 2⁄3, glabrous and pinkish-brown distally, c.12mm; stigma pinkish-brown, c.2mm in diameter. Fruit 21–28 x 7–9mm, fusiform, opening by strong valves, which curve back after the outer coat has peeled off. Seeds 3mm, without tails 1mm, the longest tail 1mm.
