## Description
Compact, stiff, often flat-topped shrub, to 6m. Sometimes forming a thick woody basal burl from which numerous epicormic shoots arise. Twigs c.3mm in diameter, rounded or angular, green or red, stellate-scaly and minutely short-hairy; internodes 1.5–4.5cm. Leaves spir­ally arranged, or in very loose pseudowhorls, clustered more densely in the upper part of the internodes. Blade 10–43 x 8–22mm, elliptic to obovate-elliptic, narrowly obovate or in the high altitude forms almost circular; apex obtuse to rounded with a conspicuous apical gland which is sometimes extended into a down-turned point; margin flat or slightly revolute, cartilaginous and distinctly crenulate; base broadly tapering; shiny green and glabrescent above although the scales often leaving blackish pits; beneath, paler-green sub-densely brown scaly. Scales rounded to lobed, with small centres, impressed into the leaf surface and leaving distinct pits where they have fallen off. Mid-vein impressed above, broad and obtusely prominent in the lower ½ beneath, less so distally; lateral veins 4–6 per side, irregular, curved ascending, slightly impressed above in fully mature leaves, faintly raised or hardly visible beneath, reticulation inconspicuous. Petiole 2–4 x 1–2mm, grooved above and slightly flattened, scaly and obscurely shortly hairy. Flower buds to 15 x 12mm, green, the bract apices standing out as short points. Bracts to 15 x 11mm, the outer ones subulate, intermediate ovate-acuminate, abruptly subulate in the upper ¼–½, innermost ones obovate-spathulate, shining, glabrous or scaly along the dorsal midline and at the apex (never hairy!), fringed with scales. Bracteoles to 12 x 1mm, linear. Inflorescence of 4–6-flowered open umbels. Flowers half-hanging to semi-erect. Pedicels 8–18 x c.1.5mm, laxly to densely brown-stellate-scaly, without hairs or with minute papillose hairs between the scales and sometimes some longer hairs just under the calyx. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, oblique, scaly at the base, deeply 5-lobed, lobes narrowly triangular or sometimes linear-subulate up to 10mm, glabrous, or occasionally long-hairy at the apex, irregular in both shape and length, sub-persistent. Corolla 20–35 x 27mm, tubular, oblique and curved, (rarely straight), deep red to purplish, pink, pale yellow or white; tube 25–30 x 6–7 x 10–12mm, laxly to sub-densely stellately scaly outside, glabrous or shortly hairy inside, swollen at the base and conspicuously grooved in the proximal ½; lobes 10–11 x 9–10mm, sub-spathulate-circular, spreading to reflexed and overlapping to c.1⁄3. Stamens exserted to 10mm, loosely arranged in the upper ½ of the flower; filaments linear, purplish-pink, glabrous or laxly shortly papillose-hairy; anthers obovate-oblong, 2–2.3 x 1mm. Disc prominent, glabrous. Ovary 4–5 x 2–3mm, conical to sub-cylindrical, densely covered with short slightly distally directed, silvery hairs which cover small scales; style glabrous or with some hairs for the basal 5mm, ultimately as long as the stamens, on the upper side of the tube, moving to a central position as the stigma becomes receptive; stigma obliquely globose. Fruit 10–20 x 6–8mm, ellipsoid, standing erect, sub-densely short-hairy and scaly. Seeds c.3mm, the tails included.
