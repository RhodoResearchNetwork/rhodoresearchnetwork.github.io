Blade 40–55 x 12–23mm, elliptic to obovate; apex shortly obtusely acuminate, rarely rounded; margin entire, flat; base tapering; sub-densely scaly initially on both sides finally glabrescent above, persistently scaly beneath. Scales thin, flat, irregularly lobed; centre small, impressed. Mid-vein shallowly impressed above, prominent beneath, especially proximally; lateral veins 6–8 per side, inconspicuous. Petiole 6–10 x c.1.3mm, grooved above, flattened, scaly initially. Bracts to 15 x 7mm, ovate to obovate-spathulate, laxly scaly outside and with hairs apically, glabrous internally, ciliate and with scales at the margin. Bracteoles 10–15 x 1mm, filiform to sub-spathulate. Inflorescence 5–7-flowered. Pedicels 9–20 x 0.5mm, densely scaly, laxly and very shortly hairy. Calyx very oblique, a thin, wavy, irregularly 5-dentate rim, one or more teeth elongate to 2–4mm. Corolla 50–60mm, trumpet-shaped, white; tube 37–50 x c.2.5 x 3–3.5mm, cylindrical, straight or slightly curved, densely scaly, not hairy outside, laxly hairy inside in the proximal 1⁄3 only; lobes c.10 x 6–7mm, spreading, spathulate-obovate, laxly scaly outside, glabrous inside. Stamens well exserted from the corolla tube; filaments filiform, hairy in the proximal ½ only; anthers c.2.5mm, oblong, base obtuse. Disc shortly hairy at the upper margin. Ovary c.5 x 1.2mm, elongate-cylindrical, sub-densely scaly and sub-appressed-hairy, gradually narrowed distally; style exserted for c.10mm, scaly and sub-patently hairy for 30mm above the base, otherwise scaly only, nearly to the top; stigma shortly obconical-globose.
