## Description
Shrub to 4m. Twigs slender, the tips with a dense brown covering of stellate scales; internodes 2–10cm. Leaves 4–6 together in pseudowhorls. Blade 30–80 x 20–40mm, elliptic to obovate-broadly elliptic; apex obtuse or sub-acuminate; margin slightly revolute at the very edge; base tapering; covered with fragile brown stellate scales initially, early glabrescent with age above, less so below especially on the veins. Scales dendroid, with a deeply stellately divided marginal zone, depressed towards the minute centre, which is prolonged downwards into a very slender stem, which rests on a distinct epidermal tubercle. Mid-vein narrowly impressed above, thickly prominent proximally below, less so distally; lateral veins 6–9 per side, irregular, curved-anastomosing before the margin, very slightly impressed or often obscure above, hardly prominent beneath. Petiole 8–14 x 1.5–2mm, densely scaly initially. Flower buds sub-globose, 10–15mm in diameter. Bracts to 12mm, thin, the outer ones ovate, densely stellate-scaly at the midline outside and with a fragile scaly fringe; inner ones sub-spathulate, glabrous. Bracteoles c.10 x 1–1.5mm, sub-spathulate-linear, glabrous. Inflorescence of 2–4-flowered open umbels. Pedicels c.10mm, slender, densely stellately scaly. Calyx c.2.5mm in diameter, obliquely rimmed, minutely 5-lobed, scaly outside. Corolla 30–40mm, tubular, curved, expanded at the lobes, zygomorphic, pale to deep red; tube 15–20 x 3 x 5mm, glossy and densely covered with golden scales outside, laxly hairy inside; lobes c.10 x 8mm, sub-spathulate-­obovate. Stamens slightly exserted; filaments linear, densely to laxly hairy in the proximal ¾, glabrous distally; anthers c.2 x 1mm, obovate-oblong, dark purple to almost black, the base obtuse. Disc prominently hairy only on the upper margin. Ovary 5 x 2.5mm, sub-cylindrical, densely covered with brown stellate scales and paler, appressed hairs, tapering distally; style c.12mm, slightly hairy at the base, glabrous distally; stigma club-shaped. Fruit 20–25 x 4–5mm, fusiform, densely scaly and hairy.
