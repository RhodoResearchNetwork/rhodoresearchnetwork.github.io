## Description
Shrub to 80cm. Twigs c.2mm in diameter, sub-densely scaly with flat appressed scales but without simple hairs; internodes 2.5–10cm. Leaves in tight pseudowhorls of 3–8 together. Blade 25–40 x 12–22mm, elliptic to obovate; apex obtuse to rounded; margin entire, narrowly revolute; base broadly tapering, then decurrent with very narrow flanges on each side of the petiole; upper leaf surface glabrescent; lower surface sparsely and more persistently scaly. Scales disc-shaped with broad, silvery, lobed margins and dark centres, slightly impressed. Mid-vein narrowly impressed above, raised beneath for most of its length; lateral veins 2–5 slender, straight veins arising at an acute angle on each side, and disappearing before the margin or obscure, reticulation obscure. Petiole 2–3 x 1–1.5mm, grooved above, somewhat flattened, smooth, densely scaly when young and with narrow lateral wings. Flower buds to c.7 x 4mm. The outer bracts subulate, the inner ovate, somewhat scaly in the central area outside and with a fringe of scales along the margins, without simple hairs. Bracteoles filiform, glabrous. Inflorescence c.4-flowered umbels. Pedicels 10–14 x 0.6mm, sub-densely scaly but without simple hairs. Flowers narrowly funnel-shaped, pink or red. Calyx a low disc, only weakly lobed, densely scaly outside, glabrous within. Corolla 35–43 x c.30mm; tube c.20 x 4 x 8mm, slightly curved, moderately to densely scaly outside, densely patently hairy inside; lobes c.20–24 x 12mm, laxly scaly outside. Stamens exserted to c.10mm; filaments patently hairy in the proximal 2⁄3, glabrous distally; anthers 1.8 x 0.7mm, with rounded bases to the cells and oblique pores. Disc prominent, densely hairy along the upper margin. Ovary c.4 x 1.8mm, sub-ovoid, densely covered in sub-appressed silvery hairs which partially cover an underlayer of brown scales, tapering abruptly distally; style c.20mm, sparsely patently hairy in the proximal 1⁄3, glabrous distally and entirely without scales along its whole length; stigma c.2.5mm in diameter, a broad irregular disc. Fruit c.17 x 4mm, with the hairs persisting and becoming patent, the outer layer peeling irregularly and the valves spreading and twisting on dehiscence.
