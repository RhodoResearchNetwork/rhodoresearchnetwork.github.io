Shrub to 80cm. Twigs smooth, green or reddish, very finely hairy and laxly scaly. Leaves 5–8 in tight pseudo­whorls, with a variable number of smaller reduced scale leaves. Blade 18–28 x 9–12mm, obovate; apex broadly pointed to rounded; margin entire, slightly recurved; base tapering; laxly scaly above and with a few simple hairs but quickly glabrescent; below laxly and more persistently scaly but without hairs. Scales stellate, flat, with a broad marginal flange and small slightly impressed centre. Mid-vein impressed above, raised below; lateral veins 2–3 per side, faint or obscure. Petiole 4–5 x 1–2mm, hairy and scaly, weakly grooved at the junction with the lamina, green. Flower buds to 8 x 4mm, ellipsoidal, green, tips of the bracts stiffly erect, hairy outside and with marginal brown scales. Inflorescences often lateral as well as terminal, of 1–2 occasionally up to 4 flowers, hanging vertically. Pedicels 17 x 1mm, red, with long, white, spreading hairs. Calyx a low green disc with a hairy margin. Corolla 23 x 26mm, bright-red, without scent; tube c.17 x 8 x 6mm, swollen just above the base and then narrowed slightly, becoming parallel sided and straight, long-hairy and with a few scales outside, hairy only near the base inside; lobes 10 x 6mm, wide-spreading, not overlapping. Stamens spreading all round the mouth of the flower; filaments 18mm, white, passing to pink distally, broadened and hairy in the proximal 4mm; anthers 1.4 x 0.8mm, brown. Ovary c.4 x 3mm, shortly cylindrical, densely hairy, with white semi-appressed hairs and brown scales covered by the hairs; style 5 x 0.5mm, green with a few hairs near the base only; stigma green, 1mm in diameter. Fruit 16 x 5mm, cylindrical, white-hairy and with brown scales, the valves spreading widely after opening. Seeds 3.3mm, without tails 1mm, the longest tail 1.2mm.
