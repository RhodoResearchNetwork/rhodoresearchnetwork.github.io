Blade 20–30 x 10–18mm, elliptic, apex rounded, often very shortly apiculate; margin sub-cartilaginous, undulate, crenulate or almost entire; base nearly rounded or broadly tapering; laxly scaly initially, glabrescent and a little rugose with age above, laxly and persistently scaly beneath. Scales flat, sub-circular, the brown marginal zone angular or irregularly lobed; centre minute, darker, weakly impressed. Mid-vein narrowly impressed above, broader, flattened and weakly, or not, prominent beneath; lateral veins inconspicuous. Petiole 2–3 x 1–2mm, somewhat flattened. Bracteoles c.13mm, filiform, glabrous. Inflorescence a 3–6-flowered open umbel. Pedicels 15–30 x 0.5mm, sub-densely covered with stellate scales and short patent hairs.
