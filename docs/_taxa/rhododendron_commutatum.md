## Description
Shrub or small tree to 3m, growing with dense-packed, slender stems. Twigs 2–4mm in diameter, rounded, densely covered with sub-stellate reddish-brown scales when young; internodes 3–12cm. Leaves 2–5 together in pseudowhorls. Blade 80–170 x 20–55mm, elliptic; apex elongate, sometimes abruptly acuminate, sub-acute; margin flat or very slightly revolute; base broadly and acutely tapering, (never rounded), sometimes the sides unequal, sub-persistently scaly above, minutely rugose by inflated epidermis cells, persistently laxly to sub-densely scaly beneath. Scales minute, marginal zone sub-stellately lobed; centres small and slightly impressed. Mid-vein very narrow and distinctly depressed above, as thick as the petiole, and strongly prominent beneath, often more densely scaly than the surrounding leaf; lateral veins 10–14 per side, spreading at almost 90°, straight below, curved and obscurely anastomosing before the margin, with additional less distinct veins, parallel, faintly impressed above, minutely raised or inconspicuous beneath, reticulation dense, visible above only. Petiole 10–15 x 1.5–2mm, flattened and grooved above, densely scaly. Bracts to 20 x 7mm; outer bracts narrowly ovate-acuminate, extended at the apex into a fine sharp point, scaly along the outside middle line distally, glabrous at the margin, inner bracts much narrower, nearly linear. Bracteoles c.15mm, filiform, laxly scaly. Inflorescence 3–5-flowered, an open umbel, the flowers semi-erect. Pedicels 10–20 x c.1mm, laxly sub-stellately scaly, not hairy. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, obliquely disc-shaped, shortly and bluntly 5-lobed, densely scaly outside. Corolla 50–65mm, funnel-shaped, bright red with purplish-pink flushed throat, lobed to c.1⁄3; tube 30–40 x 4–5 x c.15mm, lobed at the base, laxly minutely sub-stellately scaly outside, laxly short-hairy in the proximal ½ inside; lobes 20–27 x 15–24mm, half-spreading, broadly obovate-spathulate or sub-circular. Stamens unequal, exserted to c.10mm; filaments linear, sub-densely papillose-hairy proximally, papillose in the middle, glabrous in the distal 1⁄3; anthers 3–3.5 x c.1mm, oblong. Disc glabrous below, shortly hairy on the upper margin. Ovary 7–8 x c.2mm, sub-cylindrical, greyish long-hairy with distally directed hairs and densely scaly (the scales covered by the hairs), abruptly contracted distally; style thick, densely sub-patently hairy nearly to the top, less densely scaly, nearly as long as the corolla; stigma thick-rounded. Fruit c.80 x 4mm, narrowly cylindrical, curved, laxly hairy and densely scaly.
