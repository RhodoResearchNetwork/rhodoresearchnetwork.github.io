## Description
Erect rigid shrub to 2.5m. Twigs 2–3mm in diameter, rounded, stellate-scaly but very early glabrescent, and rough due to the numerous minute tubercles; internodes 2–8cm. Leaves often spirally arranged, more rarely 3–5 together in loose pseudowhorls, stiffly spreading. Blade 50–90 x 20–35mm, broadly elliptic; apex shortly acuminate, apiculate or obtuse; margin entire, revolute; base truncate to rounded, sometimes slightly cordate; when young densely scaly, early glabrescent and very rough with the persistent tubercles on both sides. Scales minute, stellate and shortly dendroid, each of which is on top of a pale epidermal tubercle. Mid-vein as thick as the petiole proximally, raised (and grooved when dry) in the proximal 1⁄3 above otherwise level or slightly impressed, distinctly raised throughout its length below; lateral veins 7–10 per side, irregular, spreading, straight, indistinctly anastomosing, inconspicuous above, slightly raised beneath; very rigid, yellowish or bluish green above, often brown from the colour of the scales below. Petiole 6–17 x 2–3mm, semi-rounded, rugose. Bracts to 20 x 10mm, ovate to obovate or spathulate, obtuse, membranous, glabrous. Bracteoles to c.20 x 1mm, linear, apex sub-spathulate, glabrous. Inflorescence a 4–10-flowered open umbel. Pedicels 15–40 x c.2mm, very densely brown stellate-scaly, without hairs. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, oblique, disc-shaped, irregularly 5-lobed, or sometimes with 1 or 2 elongate, acute lobes up to 3mm, densely scaly outside, without hairs. Corolla distinctly zygomorphic, tubular below, dilated towards the mouth, red; tube 30–55 x 5–7 x 10–15mm, densely brown stellate-scaly outside, very shortly hairy inside, distinctly curved; lobes 15–20 x 9–15mm, irregularly broadly obovate or sub-circular, densely scaly outside except near the margins. Stamens unequal, exserted to c.10mm, arranged in a distinct group on the upper side of the flower; filaments linear, laxly patently hairy below, glabrous distally; anthers 3.5–4 x 1.3–1.5mm, purple, broadly oblong to obovate-oblong. Disc glabrous. Ovary 5–6 x c.3mm, cylindrical, abruptly tapering distally; style thick, as long as the stamens, densely shortly patent-hairy and scaly in the proximal ½ with the scales clearly visible amongst the hairs, glabrous distally; stigma thick-globose, distinctly 5-lobed.
