## Description
Tree to 6m. Twigs semi-rounded, laxly to densely scaly; internodes 2.5–14cm. Leaves 5–7 together in tight pseudowhorls, with some much smaller than the others. Blade 50–100 x 20–40mm, obovate-elliptic or elliptic to broadly elliptic; apex shortly gradually acuminate, obtuse to broadly acute, sometimes with a small terminal gland; margin entire, flat; base broadly tapering, dark green above, paler and dull beneath, glabrescent above, laxly to sub-densely scaly beneath. Scales with a broad, thin marginal zone variously dentately divided; centre small, somewhat impressed and more persistent. Mid-vein raised and grooved for a few millimetres proximally otherwise slightly depressed above, raised beneath; lateral veins 8–10 per side, lower ones irregular, distinctly grooved above in the basal part, upper ones more straight and sub-parallel, curved-anastomosing with each other, smooth when fresh, prominent on both sides when dry, reticulation dense and visibly raised on both sides when dry, very distinct underneath when fresh. Petiole 6–12 x 1.5–2mm, grooved above, slightly flattened, scaly. Flower buds to 25 x 15mm, imbricate, green, smooth with the bracts appressed. Bracts to 15 x 10mm, ovate-acuminate, laxly scaly in the middle outside, also with hairs all over the outer and undersurface, glandular-ciliate. Bracteoles to 15mm, narrowly linear, glabrous. Inflorescence 4–9-flowered in erect to spreading umbels. Pedicels 10–15 x 1–1.5mm, laxly patently hairy and scaly especially in the distal 1⁄3, obliquely thickened below the calyx. Calyx c.2.5mm in diameter, membranous, indistinctly 5-lobed, laxly scaly and hairy. Corolla 60–70 x 25–30mm, trumpet-shaped, pure white, scented; tube 50–60 x 4–5 x 8–10mm, slightly curved, a little lobed at the base, sparsely scaly outside, densely hairy in the proximal ½ and glabrous distally inside; lobes 10–13 x 7–12mm, spreading, broadly obovate to sub-circular, glabrous. Stamens exserted to 10mm; filaments linear, hairy in the proximal ½, glabrous distally; anthers 2–2.3 x c.1mm, oblong, base obtuse. Disc low, glabrous. Ovary 6–7 x c.1.5mm, cylindrical, gradually narrowed distally, densely covered with sub-patent white or greyish hairs, and some obscure scales; style c.60mm, patently hairy and scaly for over ½ its length, becoming scaly only, glabrous for the distal 6–10mm; stigma exserted to 10mm, conical-globose, crenulate. Fruit (immature) to 30 x 5mm, fusiform, often curved.
