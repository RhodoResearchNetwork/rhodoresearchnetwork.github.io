## Description
Erect wiry shrub, to 1.5m, dwarfed at its highest localities. Twigs densely leafy, scaly and sometimes minutely hairy on the youngest growth. Stems with protruding leaf-cushions in the younger parts. Leaves spirally and evenly arranged, very dense and imbricate in the upper part of the twigs and held sub-erect. Blade 4–8 x 0.8–1.6mm, ‘ericoid’, linear or very narrowly elliptic; apex acute (with the extreme point rounded), with an obtuse glandular point; margin entire or somewhat indented with irregular crenulations, somewhat thickened and slightly or not revolute; base tapering, glabrescent above, laxly scaly beneath. Scales disc-shaped, entire with the darker centre thick and slightly impressed. Mid-vein very slightly impressed above, swollen underneath; lateral veins obscure. Petiole 0.6–1 x 0.4–0.6mm, scaly and with a few simple hairs, minutely grooved above and with a swollen, bulbous base. Flower buds to 3.5 x 2.5mm, pink, scaly outside. Bracts all appressed, the outermost subulate, inner ovate, scaly in the upper ½ outside, all with a ciliate margin of white hairs. Inflorescence of solitary flowers or paired, rarely up to 4 in an umbel, hanging vertically. Bracteoles c.3 x 0.5mm, linear-spathulate, long-ciliate upwards, falling early. Pedicels 5–8mm, slender, densely scaly, without hairs. Calyx slightly oblique, scaly outside, glabrous inside, with 5 distinct erect lobes, c.2 x 1–1.3mm, initially appressed to the corolla, later spreading, narrowly sub-ovate-triangular, obtuse. Corolla bright red, tubular, not or slightly oblique and curved, c.15 x 11mm; tube c.11 x 6 x 7mm, densely scaly outside, glabrous inside; lobes c.4 x 5mm, scaly outside except near the margins, broadly ovate to rounded, half-spreading and overlapping to c.halfway, the margins irregularly denticulate. Stamens grouped on the lower side of the flower, slightly exserted to c.1mm; filaments glabrous, c.11mm; anthers brown, c.0.9mm. Disc glabrous. Ovary c.1.8mm, conical, green, densely scaly, gradually tapering distally; style red, to 14mm, glabrous, finally exserted, to c.3mm; stigma club-shaped. Fruit oblong-ovoid, often a little oblique and curved, 7–10 x 3–4mm. Seeds 1.5–2mm, without tails 0.75mm, the longest tail to 0.5mm, the tails often with multiple points.
