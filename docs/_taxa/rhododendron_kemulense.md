## Description
Tree, trunk c.35cm in diameter. Twigs 3–4mm in diameter, rounded, red brown, with lax, small sub-stellate, flat scales, early glabrescent; internodes 2–8.5cm. Leaves 5–7 together in pseudowhorls. Blade 70–120 x 20–45mm, elliptic to narrowly ovate-elliptic; apex gradually tapering or shortly acuminate, sub-acute or obtuse; margin weakly recurved; base acutely narrowed; densely minutely scaly on both sides when very young, glabrescent and shining above when mature, more persistently scaly beneath. Scales minute, marginal zone irregularly lobed, fragile and disappearing early; centre dark, shallowly impressed, finally glabrescent beneath too, but remaining conspicuously punctate. Mid-vein narrow and impressed above, as broad as the petiole and obtusely prominent proximally beneath; lateral veins 7–10 per side, irregular, ascending, obscurely anastomosing, very slightly impressed above, slightly prominent or inconspicuous beneath, reticulation obscure. Petiole 4–15 x 2–2.5mm, semi-rounded, rugose, grooved above, minutely scaly. Bracteoles 20–30 x 0.5–1mm, linear, laxly hairy. Inflorescence a 7–12-flowered umbel. Pedicels 20–25 x c.1mm, laxly scaly at both ends, laxly shortly hairy, often glabrescent. Calyx 4–5mm in diameter, sub-oblique, disc-shaped, obscurely 5-angular, minutely scaly. Corolla 50–70 x 30–40mm, narrowly funnel-shaped, orange-pink; tube 30–40 x 3–5 x c.10mm, straight, sparsely minutely scaly outside, shortly hairy in the proximal ½ inside; lobes 20–30 x 15–25mm, broadly elliptic-obovate. Stamens 40–50mm, sub-equal; filaments linear and densely patently short-hairy in the proximal 1⁄3, narrower, filiform and glabrous distally; anthers 3–4 x c.1mm, oblong, base obtuse. Disc shortly hairy on the upper margin, otherwise glabrous. Ovary c.6 x 2.5mm, sub-cylindrical, scaly especially at the base and apex, early glabrescent, tapering distally; style nearly as long as the stamens, sub-densely scaly proximally, more laxly so to the middle, glabrous distally; stigma knob-like.
