## Description
Shrub. Twigs rounded, tips glabrous or very laxly scaly; internodes 2.5–9cm. Leaves 3–4 together in pseudo­whorls at the upper 3–4 nodes. Blade 40–60 x 25–55mm, ovate to sub-ovate-rounded; apex broadly and shortly acuminate, obtuse; margin entire, flat; base distinctly sub-auriculate, cordate, sessile or nearly so, superficially glabrous, but laxly covered with minute irregularly stellate scales beneath leaving a minute spot where the slightly impressed centre was. Mid-vein flat or slightly impressed above, grooved in the proximal ½, thick and very prominent beneath proximally, less so distally; lateral veins c.10 per side, 2–3 of them from the base of the blade, the others from the mid-vein, all curved-ascending and anastomosing near the edge, prominent on both sides, reticulation dense and clearly visible especially beneath. Petiole c.1 x 1.5mm. Bracteoles linear. Inflorescence a 4–5-flowered umbel. Pedicels 13–25mm, thick, sub-densely to laxly thin-scaly, thickened at apex. Calyx c.2mm in diameter, oblique, membranous, shortly, obtusely 5-lobed to 1mm, shortly fringed. Corolla trumpet-shaped, white; tube 55–60 x c.3.5 x c.7mm, slightly curved, dilated gradually upwards, laxly sub-stellately scaly outside, with dense retrorse hairs proximally, distally more laxly so with spreading hairs, glabrous below the mouth; lobes 12–15 x 10–15mm, spreading, rounded-obovate, glabrous on both sides. Stamens a little exserted; filaments narrow-linear, densely hairy at the base, more laxly and patently so in the middle, glabrous distally; anthers 2.8–3 x 1mm, oblong, base obtuse. Disc densely short-hairy especially above. Ovary c.10 x 2mm, elongate-conical, densely covered with appressed yellowish hairs and laxly with scales which tend to be hidden by the hairs, gradually tapering distally; style 55–65mm, exserted, laxly hairy and scaly at the base for c.5mm only, glabrous distally; stigma thick-conical, crenulate.
