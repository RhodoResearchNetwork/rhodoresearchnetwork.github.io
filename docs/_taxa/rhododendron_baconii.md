## Description
Shrub or tree to 9m. Twigs smooth, green, sparsely scaly when young. Leaves 4–6 in tight pseudowhorls between which are scattered scale leaves that soon fall off. Blade 35–80 x 15–35mm, elliptic to broadly elliptic; apex rounded or retuse; margin entire, strongly recurved even in the fresh state in fully mature leaves; base rounded or broadly tapering; sparsely scaly, quickly becoming glabrescent above and often beneath as well, smooth. Scales variable in size, slightly impressed, sub-circular to lobed, mostly with small centres and relatively broad flanges. Mid-vein impressed above and strongly raised below throughout its length; lateral veins 4–6 per side, widely spreading, very slightly raised beneath, almost smooth and fairly obscure above. Petiole 1–2 x 2.5–3mm, sparsely scaly, weakly grooved above. Flower buds to 20 x 13mm, pale green, ovoid, the scales thick and fleshy, the broadly tapering points reflexed well away from the surface of the bud. Outer bracts fringed with minute brown scales along their edges and evenly covered with very fine, minute, patent white hairs on the outer side and also on the inner, near the apex. Bracteoles 11–14 x c.1mm, linear, hairy outside. Inflorescence 3–6-flowered, (8 in cultivation), the flowers displayed horizontally to half-hanging in an open umbel. Pedicels 23–32 x c.2mm, densely hairy and with a few scales. Calyx 3mm in diameter, a low hairy ring or with broad, well-marked lobes. Corolla 30–35 x 33–40mm, pink, not scented; tube 17–22 x 8–10 x 12–15mm, scaly outside, hairy near the base inside; lobes c.18 x 16–20mm, slightly emarginate, spreading almost to right angles, overlapping to c.2⁄3, finely scaly outside. Stamens arranged regularly all round the flower, distinctly dimorphic to about ½ the length of the anthers; filaments 15mm, pink, with spreading hairs in the proximal 1⁄3; anthers 3mm, pale brown. Ovary 3.5 x 2.5mm, densely hairy with spreading hairs and a sparse covering of silvery scales; style 6–13mm, hairy in the proximal 1⁄3; stigma 2mm in diameter, glossy red, central in position. Fruit to 14 x 7mm, softly hairy. Seeds 2.4mm, without tails 1.2mm, the longest tail 0.8mm.
