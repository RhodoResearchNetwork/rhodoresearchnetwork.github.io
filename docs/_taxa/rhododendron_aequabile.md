## Description
Large shrub or tree to 4m. Twigs thick, rounded, densely dark-brown scaly; internodes 3.5–16cm. Leaves 6–9 together in tight pseudowhorls at the upper 2 or 3 nodes. Blade 40–90 x 20–40mm, elliptic; apex shortly acuminate or apiculate, sub-acute to obtuse; margin broadly revolute (the leaves somewhat convex); base tapering, glabrescent at maturity above, or with a few small silvery scales remaining, very densely dark-brown persistently scaly beneath. Scales entire, with a broad marginal flange and moderately large, dark centre, dense with many touching or slightly overlapping. Mid-vein impressed over its entire length above, strongly prominent beneath; lateral veins 5–10 per side, spreading, straight below, anastomosing towards the edge, slightly but distinctly depressed above, weakly raised beneath or indistinct. Petiole 18–22 x 2–3mm, distinctly grooved above in the distal ½, densely brown-scaly. Flower buds spherical, brown, but with long, wide-spreading, protruding, broadly subulate bract apices, and a long acute point. Bracts broadly ovate, long acuminate, densely brown-scaly in the upper ½ outside, green near the base, inside brown-scaly for a broad band near the margins and densely scaly on the acumen. Bracteoles to 10mm, filiform, with just a few scales. Inflorescence of 5–10 flowers held horizontally in a compact, open umbel. Flowers 15–18 x 34–40mm, orange, without scent. Pedicels 10–14 x 2–3mm, orange, thickened distally, often curved, densely scaly with some long stalked scales but without hairs. Calyx 3–4mm in diameter, small, oblique, disc-shaped, angular, densely scaly outside. Corolla campanulate; tube 11–15 x 7–10 x 16–20mm, laxly to sub-densely inconspicuously scaly outside, glabrous inside; lobes 12–15 x 17–21mm, obovate-circular, rounded, slightly retuse, or sometimes subdivided into miniature lobe-like structures, spreading horizontally or reflexed back, with some scales outside near the base, overlapping to c.halfway. Stamens regularly arranged all round the mouth of the flower, very slightly dimorphic; filaments 10–13mm, pink, linear, glabrous; anthers c.2 x 1mm, oblong, dark brown, exserted to c.2mm. Disc glabrous. Ovary c.4 x 3.5mm, conical-ovoid, densely scaly, without hairs, abruptly contracted distally; style 8–10mm, glabrous; stigma 2–3mm in diameter, centrally placed in the mouth, rounded to weakly 5-lobed. Fruit ellipsoidal, 14–17 x 6–7mm, smooth, densely brown-scaly. Seeds 4mm including the tails.
