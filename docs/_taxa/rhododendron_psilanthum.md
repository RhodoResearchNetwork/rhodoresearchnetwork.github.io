## Description
Shrub. Twigs slender, rounded, c.2mm in diameter, the tips densely brown-stellate-scaly when young, quickly becoming glabrescent and smooth; internodes c.6.5cm. Leaves sub-opposite or 3 together in a pseudowhorl. Blade 35–45 x 13–22mm, elliptic; apex shortly sub-acutely acuminate and apiculate; margin slightly revolute; base tapering into the petiole; stellately scaly on both sides initially. Scales minute, dendroid, each on top of minute epidermal tubercle, quickly glabrescent above, less so beneath, but finally glabrescent and rough on both sides. Mid-vein a little impressed above and raised beneath, the lateral veins inconspicuous. Petiole 5–6 x c.1mm, densely scaly. Inflorescence a 3-flowered umbel. Pedicels 12–15 x c.0.5mm, slender, very densely stellately scaly. Calyx c.2mm in diameter, minute, oblique, in the form of a short cup, sub-entire. Corolla 35–38mm, tubular below, dilated upwards, slightly zygomorphic, red; tube c.25 x 4–5 x c.8mm, pouched at the base, completely glabrous on both sides; lobes 10–12 x 8–10mm, spreading, broadly obovate-spathulate. Stamens c.30mm, slightly unequal; filaments narrowly linear, glabrous; anthers c.2.2 x 1mm, obovate-oblong, very shortly appendaged at the base. Disc prominent, glabrous. Ovary c.4 x 2mm, sub-ovoid-cylindrical, very densely stellately scaly, and abruptly tapering distally; style 25mm, stellately scaly at the base, otherwise entirely glabrous; stigma sub-globose.
