## Description
Much-branched shrub or tree, to 2m. Twigs 1–2.5mm in diameter, erect or erecto-patent, the tips densely covered with scales, the lower parts rough to the touch with scale stalks; internodes 4–11cm. Leaves in loose pseudo­whorls, with 7–12 leaves, in the upper 1⁄3 or ½ of the internode. Blade 10–25 x 6–16mm, sub-circular to elliptic, rarely sub-ovate-elliptic; apex obtuse to rounded, with a small glandular point; margin flat or slightly revolute, crenulate with impressed scales; base broadly tapering to rounded; glabrescent above, but often densely pitted, not rough to the touch, undersurface densely scaly, the scales mostly touching and overlapping. Scales of two sizes: small silvery scales with small impressed centres which leave pits after they have fallen and regularly scattered amongst them, larger, brown, scales, with large swollen centres. Mid-vein impressed in a narrow groove above, somewhat raised beneath, sometimes becoming indistinct distally; lateral veins 4–6 per side, irregularly spreading and curved-ascending, anastomosing, slightly depressed above, faintly raised beneath. Petiole 2–4 x 1–1.5mm, grooved above, scaly. Flower buds to 12 x 8mm, ovoid, smooth or with the tips of the bracts slightly spreading. Outer bracts ovate to sub-circular-ovate, sub-acuminate, with a narrow raised keel, inner ones ovate to spathulate, obtuse, thin, scaly outside towards the apex, all fringed with scales. Bract­eoles linear-spathulate, glabrous, up to 8mm. Inflorescence an open umbel of 4–6 flowers, the flowers horizontal or half-hanging. Pedicels 10–13mm, densely covered with sessile, or very shortly stalked scales. Calyx 3–4mm in diameter, oblique, disc-shaped, scaly outside, wavy and irregularly minutely lobed, sometimes with one lobe longer than the others. Corolla 17–20 x 10–12mm, yellow or orange, elongate-campanulate; tube 10–13 x 4–5 x 7–8mm, straight, densely scaly outside, glabrous inside; lobes 4–5 x 4–5mm, not or hardly reflexed, overlapping to c.¾, scaly except near the margins, irregularly crenate and often retuse. Stamens arranged all round the mouth, exserted to c.2mm; filaments linear but expanded near the base, glabrous, 10–12mm; anthers sub-orbicular, c.1mm. Disc glabrous. Ovary 3–4 x 2.5–3mm, broadly ovoid-conical, densely silvery scaly, abruptly contracted distally; style 3–4mm, glabrous, stigma shortly 5-lobed, centrally placed. Fruit 13–15 x 6–7mm, ellipsoid to obovoid-fusiform, conspicuously 5-ribbed, densely brown-scaly, becoming erect on the pedicels which elongate to 22mm, the style not elongating. Seeds 3–3.5mm, without tails 0.9mm, the longest tail c.1.5mm.
