## Description
Prostrate shrub to 15cm. Twigs c.1mm in diameter, covered with stalked stellate scales, becoming glabrescent, laxly warty. Leaves spirally arranged, not aggregated into pseudowhorls. Blade 6–12 x 4–8mm, ovate or elliptic; apex broadly acute to obtuse, sometimes with a protruding gland; margin entire to sub-crenulate, cartilaginous, narrowly revolute; base broadly tapering to rounded; quickly glabrescent above, more persistently but laxly scaly beneath. Scales irregularly obtusely stellate-lobed, slightly or not impressed. Mid-vein impressed above and raised beneath, or almost smooth; lateral veins obscure. Petiole c.1–1.5 x 1mm, grooved above, scaly. Flower buds to 13 x 7mm, ovate, acute with the bract tips spreading out, almost glabrous. Bracts to 10 x 5mm, ovate, glabrous outside except for a few scales near the acute points outside. Flowers 1–2, horizontal to hanging. Pedicels 10–17 x 0.5mm, sub-densely stellate-scaly, with or without hairs. Calyx c.2.5mm in diameter, disc-shaped, obscurely 5-lobed. Corolla 25–30 x 14–18mm, pink to red, without scent; tube 20–25 x 4–5 x 10–12mm, tubular, slightly expanded upwards, very sparsely scaly outside, glabrous inside, oblique; lobes 5–7 x 5–7mm, sub-circular, half-spreading. Stamens unequal, exserted to c.3mm; filaments linear, glabrous; anthers sub-orbicular, c.1.5mm. Disc prominent, glabrous. Ovary sub-cylindrical, densely scaly, c.3–6 x 2mm, gradually tapering distally; style glabrous, nearly as long as the corolla; stigma obconical-­globose. Fruit 18–22 x c.2.5mm, fusiform.
