## Description
Shrub to 2m. Twigs rounded, 2–3mm in diameter, laxly scaly; internodes 3–8cm. Leaves 4–10 together in well-marked pseudowhorls sometimes with one or two much smaller leaves. Blade 50–100 x 6–16mm, narrowly elliptic to sub-linear, often slightly curved; apex acute; margin entire or irregularly sinuate, weakly revolute; base narrowly tapering, glabrescent above when mature, sparsely scaly beneath. Scales flat, circular or irregularly disc-shaped, marginal zone entire or variously, often obtusely and shallowly lobed; centre minute, weakly impressed. Mid-vein narrow, impressed above, prominent beneath in the proximal ½–¾; lateral veins 5–10 per side, ascending and joining towards the margin, slightly raised above, faintly so or not visible beneath, sub-densely reticu­late and very slightly raised above only when dry. Petiole 4–6 x 1–1.5mm, grooved above, laxly scaly. Flower buds to 25 x 8mm, very narrowly conical, acute, the bract tips erect, slightly gaping, green or flushed with pink. Bracts to 24 x 5mm, very narrowly ovate, with acute channelled points, glabrous. Bracteoles subulate, glabrous, to 10mm. Inflorescence 1–5-flowered in an open umbel, the flowers horizontal to half-hanging. Pedicels scaly at base and apex, almost glabrous between, 12–17 x c.1.25mm. Calyx disc-shaped, obtusely and very shortly 5-lobed, laxly scaly outside, 3–4mm in diameter. Corolla 25–35 x 30–50mm, funnel-shaped, tubular below, pale yellow or suffused with orange around the edges of the lobes, without scent; tube 15–20 x 5–6 x 10–12mm, straight, constricted about the middle and often fluted in the proximal ½, glabrous outside, hairy inside; lobes 22–26 x 13–26mm, spreading, obovate-spathulate, overlapping up to ½. Stamens irregularly spreading, exserted to c.10mm; filaments linear and densely hairy in the lowest 3–4mm, glabrous and more filiform distally; anthers obovate-oblong, c.2.5 x 0.8mm, base obtuse. Disc prominent, green, hairy on the upper margin. Ovary 6–8 x 2–2.5mm, densely hairy and scaly; style lying on the lower side of the tube, curving upwards to present the stigma in a central position when receptive, hairy at the base for 1–2mm, otherwise glabrous; stigma globose, becoming disc-shaped and deeply 5-lobed. Fruit 20–30 x 4–5mm, fusiform-cylindric. Seeds c.6mm, without tails 0.8mm, the longest tail c.3mm.
