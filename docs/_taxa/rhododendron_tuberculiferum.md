## Description
Shrub to 1.5m. Twigs 2–3mm in diameter, rounded, at first with dendroid, stellate scales, the older parts glabrescent and covered in tubercles; internodes 1.8–11cm. Leaves 5–7 crowded towards the upper nodes, or in pseudowhorls. Blade 17–48 x 10–21mm, ovate, ovate-elliptic or broadly elliptic; apex obtusely acuminate or obtuse, sometimes apiculate; margin weakly to strongly recurved; base rounded-obtuse to slightly cordate, sub-sessile; densely brown-scaly on both sides when very young. Scales stellate, sub-sessile or sub-dendroid, each on top of a minute persistent epidermal tubercle, quickly glabrescent especially above, distinctly tuberculate and rough to the touch on both sides. Mid-vein impressed above, prominent beneath; lateral veins obscure. Petiole 1–4 x 1.5–2mm, at first densely scaly, later rough with tubercles. Bracts to 18 x 6mm; outer bracts triangular, subulate-acuminate at the apex, the inner ones ovate-acuminate to spathulate and shortly apiculate or obtuse, glabrous on both sides, sub-denticulate. Bracteoles to 20 x c.1mm, linear, glabrous. Inflorescence of 2–6 flowers in an umbel. Pedicels 15–30mm, slender, densely scaly. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, disc-shaped, oblique, scaly outside, very shortly obtusely 5-lobed. Corolla 38–45mm, zygomorphic, tubular below, funnel-shaped towards the mouth, red; tube 25–32 x 4–6 x 8–10mm, densely scaly outside, laxly hairy in the lower 2⁄3 of the tube inside, glabrous distally; lobes 9–12mm in diameter, 5 (rarely 6), scaly outside except at the margins, sub-circular, retuse. Stamens 10, (rarely 12), sub-equal, 28–35mm; filaments linear, laxly hairy proximally, less so upwards, glabrous distally; anthers c.3 x 1mm, oblong, the base obtuse. Disc minutely hairy, or practically glabrous. Ovary c.7 x 2.5mm, elongate-conical, abruptly contracted distally, very densely scaly, with some hairs between the scales in the upper part; style c.17mm, with some patent hairs at the base, glabrous distally; stigma globose.
