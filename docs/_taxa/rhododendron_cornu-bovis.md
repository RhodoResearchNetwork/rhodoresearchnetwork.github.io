## Description
Small straggling shrub to 2m. Twigs c.1mm in diameter, rounded, tips flattened and densely covered with reddish-brown, sub-stellate scales; internodes 2–4cm. Leaves 4–6 together in pseudowhorls. Blade 25–40 x 8–14mm, obovate-elliptic to obovate; apex broadly tapering, obtuse or rounded; margin slightly recurved; base tapering, scaly on both sides at first, quickly glabrescent above, persistently sub-densely scaly beneath. Scales large, flat, irregularly stellately divided in the marginal zone; centre slightly impressed. Mid-vein grooved above, prominent beneath; lateral veins 3–4 per side, inconspicuous, often obscure beneath. Petiole 2–4mm, scaly. Bracts to 8 x 5mm, broadly ovate to ovate-elliptic, obtuse, glabrous outside, except for the marginal scales. Bracteoles c.5mm, filiform, laxly scaly. Inflorescence 2–3-flowered. Pedicels 10–14 x 0.5–0.7mm, slender, sub-densely stellately scaly and sparsely, shortly patently hairy. Calyx c.2.5mm in diameter, disc-shaped, oblique, scaly and shortly hairy outside, indistinctly 5-lobed. Corolla c.25 x 20mm, obliquely tubular-funnel-shaped, pink to red; tube 12–14 x 4–5 x 6–8mm, sub-densely to laxly covered with reddish-brown sub-stellate scales outside, laxly hairy inside, slightly curved; lobes 9–10 x 6–7mm, spreading, obovate-spathulate. Stamens exserted to c.5mm, sub-equal; filaments filiform, laxly patently hairy for the proximal 2⁄3, glabrous distally; anthers c.1.6mm, broadly oblong. Disc prominent, glabrous. Ovary c.5 x 2mm, sub-cylindrical, densely short-hairy and scaly, the scales covered by the hairs, tapering distally; style oblique, laxly patently hairy in the proximal ½, without scales, glabrous distally, nearly equalling the corolla in length; stigma sub-globose. Fruit (sub-mature) 22 x 4mm, sub-fusiform-cylindric, curved, densely hairy and scaly.
