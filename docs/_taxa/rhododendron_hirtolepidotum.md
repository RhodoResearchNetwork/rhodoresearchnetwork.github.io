## Description
Shrub to 2.5m. Twigs 2–5mm in diameter, rounded, sub-densely covered when young with fragile, sub-stellate, reddish-brown scales, later glabrous and smooth; internodes 2–18cm. Leaves 4–8 together in pseudo­whorls. Blade 40–105 x 20–42mm, elliptic, or obovate-elliptic; apex broadly tapering or shortly sub-acuminate, obtuse to nearly rounded; margin slightly revolute; base broadly tapering, sub-truncate to rounded, rarely sub-cordate; glabrescent above when mature, densely and more persistently scaly beneath. Scales small, variously sub-stellate-lobed in the marginal zone; centres dark, slightly impressed, scale pits black and shallow. Mid-vein slightly impressed above, thick and prominent in the proximal part beneath; lateral veins 6–10 per side, spreading, straight below, curved and indistinctly anastomosing before the margin, slightly raised on both sides, or a little impressed above, reticulation obscure. Petiole 4–16 x 1.5–2.5mm, semi-rounded, grooved above, scaly and rugulose. Bracts to 15 x 8mm, ovate to obovate, obtuse, firm-membranous, with some sparse scales at the top outside or quite glabrous. Bracteoles to 22 x 1.5mm, linear below, sub-spathulate apically, glabrous. Inflorescence 5–9-flowered. Pedicels 30–40 x 0.6–0.8mm, sparsely stellate-scaly proximally, more densely so distally. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, oblique, disc-shaped, 5-angular, outside densely scaly. Corolla 44–50mm, tubular below, sub-oblique, red, membranous; tube 20–30 x 6–7 x 7–8mm, laxly to sub-densely scaly outside, lobed at the base, shortly hairy in the proximal ½ inside; lobes 9–17 x 10–12mm, obliquely obovate-spathulate. Stamens slightly shorter than the corolla; filaments linear, densely hairy proximally, less so distally; anthers 3.5–4 x 1mm, oblong, obtuse at the base. Disc shortly hairy on the upper margin, glabrous below. Ovary c.8 x 2.5mm, sub-cylindrical, densely stellate-scaly, with some spreading hairs at the top between the scales, gradually tapering distally; style as long as the corolla tube, laxly scaly and sub-densely patently hairy in the proximal 10–15mm, glabrous distally; stigma deeply 5-lobed. Fruit 35–40 x 4–5mm, sub-cylindrical, sub-densely covered with red-brown scales.
