## Description
Shrub or small tree to 2.5(-5)m tall; bark thinly and vertically furrowed;

            young twigs pale brown, very sparsely to moderately covered with unicellular hairs and

            with scattered multicellular gland-headed hairs, sometimes with multicellular eglandular

            hairs intermixed; new foliage shoots arising from axillary buds associated with the

            lowest scaly leaves of the present year's shoots (i.e. within the terminal bud), and from some terminal buds. Vegetative bud scales sparsely to densely covered with pale to ferrugineous, multicellular eglandular hairs intermixed with a few inconspicuous unicellular hairs on both surfaces; margin fringed with multicellular eglandular and unicellular hairs; lowermost scales with long aristate apices or rudimentary blades. Leaves deciduous, dark green adaxially, pale abaxially, turning yellow, orange and red in autumn, pseudo-verticillate, with (4 or) 5(-9) leaves clustered at apex of shoot and sometimes 1 or 2 smaller leaves borne along shoot below terminal cluster. Blade membranaceous, obovate, often very broadly so, to nearly orbicular or elliptic, 2.5-11.7 x 0.9-7.2cm; base narrowly to broadly cuneate to attenuate; apex occasionally obtuse but more commonly rounded to emarginate, with a short mucro; midvein and secondary veins slightly to strongly raised and prominent abaxially; adaxial surface sparsely to moderately covered with + curled unicellular hairs and scattered multicellular gland-headed hairs, the midvein moderately to densely covered with curled to straight unicellular hairs and scattered multicellular gland-headed hairs; abaxial surface glabrous to sparsely unicellular-pubescent (especially at base of blade), the lateral surfaces of mid vein + densely fringed with long, straight to crisped, unicellular hairs (especially near base), and the middle portion sparsely to moderately covered with short, curled unicellular hairs, or such hairs lacking, throughout with scattered multicellular short- to long-stalked gland-headed hairs, the secondary veins with only scattered multicellular gland-headed or eglandular hairs with indumentum similar to that of midvein (especially towards base of blade); margin entire to irregularly undulate/crenate with fringe of multicellular gland-headed to eglandular hairs; petiole 2-6.5mm long, very sparsely to densely covered with unicellular hairs and with scattered multicellular gland-headed hairs, sometimes with a few multicellular eglandular hairs, the base of petiole abruptly expanded into a somewhat broadened point of attachment. Flower bud scales with abaxial surface moderately to densely covered with ± ferrugineous elongate multicellular eglandular hairs and sparsely covered with unicellular hairs; margin ciliate with multicellular eglandular (and sometimes also gland-headed) hairs and unicellular hairs. Flowers appearing before or with the leaves; inflorescence an umbellate raceme of 3 to 6 flowers. Pedicels 8-23mm long, moderately to densely covered with multicellular gland-headed hairs, sometimes also very sparsely unicellular-pubescent. Calyx lobes broadly Ungulate, ovate or nearly orbicular, to obovate or ovate, 1.5-7 x 1.5-4.7mm; apex rounded; margin fringed with unicellular hairs and multicellular gland-headed hairs; adaxial surface glabrous to moderately unicellular-pubescent; abaxial surface moderately covered with multicellular gland-headed hairs, often also very sparsely unicellular-pubescent. Corolla very light to deep pink, with red-brown spots on the upper three lobes, fragrant, zygomorphic, broadly rotate to funnelform, the tube much shorter than the limb and gradually expanding into it; upper corolla lobe 1.5-2.8 x 1.6-2.9cm; lateral lobes 1.5-3.5 x 1.2-2.5cm; corolla tube 0.8-1.2am long; outer surface of corolla glabrous; inner surface of corolla sparsely unicellular-pubescent towards base. Stamens 10, declinate, dimorphic, the upper 5, 1.5-2.6cm long, the lower 5, 3-4.5cm long, included to slightly exserted; filament glabrous distally, becoming densely covered with flattened unicellular hairs proximally. Ovary 3.5-4mm long, moderately covered with multicellular gland-headed hairs; style declinate, 2.7-4cm long, glabrous distally, but with scattered multicellular gland-headed hairs on proximal portion. Capsules ovoid, 1-1.9 x0.6~lcm, moderately covered with multicellular gland-headed hairs. Seeds shiny and dark chestnut-brown, angular-ovoid to ellipsoid, 1.6-2.7 x 0.7-lmm; testa tightly appressed to body, tails lacking, the cells elongate. Cotyledons with multicellular gland-headed hairs along margin and well-developed reticulate venation. 2k ó26 (Sax, 1930).
