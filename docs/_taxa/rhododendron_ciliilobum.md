## Description
Erect shrub. Twigs rounded, sub-densely covered with reddish sessile or sub-sessile scales, without simple hairs. Leaves in a loose pseudowhorl, or spirally arranged several together at the tips of the stems. Blade 12–20 x 5–10mm, obovate; apex very shortly retuse, rarely rounded; margin very shortly revolute proximally, otherwise flat; base tapering, laxly scaly above, glabrescent with age and becoming a little rough, sub-densely scaly beneath. Scales sub-circular, sessile, marginal zone narrow and thin, sub-entire, centre large, thick and distinctly impressed. Mid-vein slightly impressed above, obtusely raised beneath, disappearing distally; lateral veins obscure above, weakly or not visible beneath. Petiole 2–3mm, rounded, scaly. Bracts to 6 x 3mm, ovate to obovate-spathulate, apiculate, with silky hairs and scaly in the upper outer part, densely white-fringed along the margins. Bracteoles to 5mm, filiform, hairy at the apex. Inflorescence of solitary or paired flowers, hanging vertically. Pedicels 6–10mm, slender, densely to laxly scaly with shortly stalked scales, and sometimes laxly short-hairy. Calyx c.2mm in diameter, minute, wavy and spreading, or with the narrow margin reflexed, scaly and very shortly hairy outside, with very short and obtuse lobes. Corolla 20mm, tubular; tube c.18 x 3 x 5mm, laxly scaly outside, glabrous inside; lobes c.4 x 3–4mm, ovate to sub-circular, erect at first, later spreading, distinctly irregularly-denticulate and ciliate at the apex. Stamens as long as the corolla on opening, finally slightly exserted; filaments filiform, glabrous; anthers 1.3mm. Disc glabrous. Ovary c.2.5 x 1.5mm, sub-ovoid-cylindrical, very densely scaly, gradually tapering distally; style c.17mm, thick-filiform, glabrous; stigma club-shaped, irregularly lobed. Fruit c.13 x 3.5mm, obliquely sub-cylindrical, deeply 5-grooved.
