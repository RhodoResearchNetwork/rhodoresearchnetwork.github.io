## Description
Shrub to 1.5m. Twigs erect, slender, tips laxly scaly with stalked scales, lower parts covered with the scars and thick leaf-cushions of the fallen leaves. Leaves densely spiral. Blade 5–14 x 3–8mm, ovate, elliptic-ovate or elliptic; apex shortly acuminate or acute with a small terminal gland; margin slightly cartilaginous, flat, crenulate where marginal scales are attached; base sub-truncate, rounded, or broadly tapering; very laxly scaly and early glabrescent above, laxly and persistently scaly beneath. Scales circular or nearly so; margin entire or sub-entire; centre mostly small, not or weakly impressed. Mid-vein minutely or not impressed above, slightly raised beneath; lateral veins obscure or 1 or 2 per side faintly visible. Petiole 1–2 x c.2mm, laxly scaly. Bracts to 13 x 8mm, ovate-acuminate, membranous, glabrous or laxly scaly outside along the mid-vein, glossy, the margin crenulate with sunken glands distally, entire proximally. Bracteoles 6–10 x 1–2mm, linear-sub-spathulate, glabrous. Flowers solitary or in pairs. Pedicels 10–14mm, thick, densely covered with sub-sessile scales. Calyx minute, oblique, disc-shaped with an undulate margin, laxly scaly outside. Corolla 25–32mm, tubular, dark to light red; tube 16–22 x 3–4 x 8–10mm, laxly scaly proximally, almost glabrous distally, glabrous inside; lobes 6–8 x 4–6mm, broadly elliptic to sub-circular, erect or slightly spreading, overlapping to c.¾, margin undulate. Stamens c.25mm, unequal; filaments linear, glabrous, somewhat dilated towards the base, filiform distally; anthers 1.5–1.7 x c.1mm, brown, broadly sub-obovate-elliptic. Disc glabrous, the lobes thick and a little prominent. Ovary c.4 x 2mm, obliquely ovoid-conical, very densely scaly, without hairs, abruptly narrowed distally; style c.15mm, glabrous; stigma gradually thickened or conical, its numerous lobes irregularly club-shaped.
