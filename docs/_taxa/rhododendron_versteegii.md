## Description
Erect shrub to 1m, with arching branches sometimes appearing from below ground. Twigs rounded, densely covered with sessile scales, early glabrescent and smooth, with conspicuous rounded lateral buds; internodes 2–12cm. Leaves spiral or in loose pseudowhorls in the upper ½–2⁄3 of the internodes. Blade 15–35 x 8–20mm, elliptic or broadly elliptic, sometimes slightly obovate, or rarely ovate-elliptic; apex obtuse to rounded, sometimes with a shortly protruding apical gland; margin flat or weakly revolute when dry, minutely crenulate; base truncate, rounded, or broadly tapering, very densely scaly on both sides initially, glabrescent above, scaly for a longer time beneath. Scales forming a coherent layer, irregularly stellate, slightly overlapping, marginal zone wide; centres small and impressed leaving pits after the scales have gone. Mid-vein narrowly grooved above in the proximal ½, thick and obtusely prominent in the proximal ½ beneath, often becoming obscure distally; lateral veins 2–4 per side, often obscure. Petiole 2–3 x 1–2mm, flattened and grooved above, scaly. Bracts to 19 x 8mm; outer bracts ovate-elliptic, sub-acuminate or obtuse, inner ones elliptic to elliptic-spathulate, membranous, scaly along the outside midline, otherwise glabrous. Bracteoles to 16mm, linear to linear-sub-spathulate, glabrous. Inflorescence of 3–8 flowers, in an open umbel. Pedicels 9–20 x c.1mm, very densely brown scaly but without hairs. Flowers 30–40 x 30–35mm, hanging to half-hanging. Calyx 4–5mm in diameter, oblique, disc-shaped, densely scaly, obtusely 5-lobed, sometimes with one or more lobes larger and more elongate. Corolla funnel-shaped, red and yellow, in an irregular pattern, the yellow mostly on the lobes where the surface has been recently exposed as the flower finally opens; tube 18–22 x 4–5 x 6–8mm, laxly to sub-densely scaly outside, glabrous inside, somewhat angular, slightly pouched at the base; lobes 10–14 x 10–13mm, obovate to sub-circular, half-spreading, and overlapping to c.halfway, scaly outside near the base except near the margins. Stamens exserted to c.4mm, unequal; filaments linear, glabrous; anthers c.2.5 x 1mm, obovate-oblong. Disc prominent, green, glabrous. Ovary 5–6 x 2.5–3mm, shortly conical, very densely scaly and patently hairy (the hairs obscuring the scales), abruptly contracted distally; style slender, as long as the corolla, densely scaly and laxly to sparsely hairy in the lower 1⁄3–2⁄5, or almost completely glabrous; stigma globose, distinctly 5-lobed. Fruit 13–20 x 5–6mm, oblong-conical, 5-ribbed, densely scaly and hairy, broadest below the middle, held erect.
