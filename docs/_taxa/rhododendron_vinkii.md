## Description
Shrub. Twigs 1.5–3mm in diameter, rounded, densely covered at the ends with sub-circular, sessile or sub-sessile scales; internodes 2–5cm. Leaves 3–5 together in pseudowhorls at the upper 2–3 nodes. Blade 35–60 x 15–22mm, elliptic to slightly obovate; apex broadly tapering, obtuse, rarely slightly retuse; margin slightly revolute especially proximally; base tapering into the petiole; densely scaly on both sides initially, glabrescent above with age, persistently scaly beneath. Scales circular or almost so, thick, impressed, distant (for 2–3 times their diameter). Mid-vein slightly impressed above, prominent proximally beneath but gradually narrowed and less prominent distally; lateral veins 6–8 per side, impressed above, obscure beneath, reticulation faintly impressed above, or almost inconspicuous. Petiole 5–8 x c.1mm, grooved above, densely scaly. Outer bracts to 10mm, ovate, inner ones obovate to spathulate, glabrous outside, but with a scaly margin. Bracteoles filiform. Inflorescence 2–3-flowered. Pedicels 12–18mm, slender, densely patently hairy and scaly. Calyx c.2.5mm in diameter, obliquely rounded, indistinctly obtusely 5-lobed. Corolla c.25mm, sub-obliquely tubular, light red, sub-densely covered with thick sub-­circular scales outside, laxly hairy inside; tube c.20 x 3–4 x c.6mm, lobes c.5 x 6–7mm, spathulate-obovate. Stamens slightly exserted from the throat; filaments linear and shortly hairy below, glabrescent in the upper ¼; anthers broadly oblong, c.2mm. Disc densely erect-hairy. Ovary c.4 x 2mm, cylindrical, yellowish hairy, the hairs covering scales, abruptly contracted distally; style 12–16mm, thick, densely patently hairy proximally, less so distally, glabrous for c.2mm below the globose stigma.
