## Description
Shrub to 3m. Twigs c.4mm in diameter, rounded, stellate scaly; internodes 3–6cm. Leaves 3 together in pseudo­whorls and spirally along the internodes. Blade 60–90 x 35–50mm, elliptic, broadly elliptic or ovate elliptic; apex rounded or obtuse; margin revolute; base rounded to weakly cordate; when young golden stellate-scaly on both sides, becoming glabrescent above but rough with epidermal tubercles; below more persistently scaly. Scales stellately divided, tapering to a short foot with distinct, whitish epidermal tubercles when mature and dry, rough to the touch. Mid-vein only slightly impressed above, grooved for 5–8mm proximally; strongly raised beneath; lateral veins 6–7 per side, irregular, visibly raised on both sides, reticulation obscure below. Petiole 7–12 x 2–3.5mm, only faintly grooved, densely scaly, the scales leaving a papillose surface when they have gone. Flower buds to 35 x 17mm, ovoid, smooth, green. Bracts to 45 x 20mm, ovate to sub-spathulate, appressed hairy on both sides and with a few small brown scales outside and prominent brown marginal scales. Bract­eoles 18–30mm, linear, channelled, somewhat broadened upwards to 2mm wide, densely hairy and with scales along the margins. Inflorescence 2–5-flowered in an open umbel, the flowers horizontal to half-hanging. Pedicels 8–10 x 2mm, densely scaly and with hairs protruding above the scales. Calyx c.7mm in diameter, 5-lobed, densely scaly and white hairy outside, glabrous inside, the lobes c.2mm long. Corolla 70–100 x 70–75mm, 5-lobed, tubular below, expanded above, white with a waxy appearance but spotted with pink at the base of the lobes, strongly scented; tube 60–70 x 7–8 x 15–20mm, glabrous outside, hairy for 40–50mm proximally inside; lobes 30–40 x 26–30mm, rounded to spathulate, glabrous. Stamens c.60mm long, exserted to c.15mm, at first in a tight cluster in the centre of the flower, later spreading irregularly around the mouth; filaments densely to laxly hairy, white; anthers 7–8 x c.1.5mm, creamy to pale yellow, obtuse at the base, the pollen pale yellow. Disc, white hairy. Ovary cylindrical, c.10 x 4mm, white hairy, gradually contracted distally; style c.50mm, the proximal 40mm densely covered in distally pointing white hairs, the ultimate 10mm glabrous, lying on the lower side of the flower, curving upwards later; stigma green, c.2mm in diameter. Fruit (sub-mature) 30–40 x c.10mm, oblong, grooved, hairy.
