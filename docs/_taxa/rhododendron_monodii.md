## Description
Shrub or tree to 4m. Twigs 2–4mm in diameter, rounded, at first densely patently short-hairy and laxly brown scaly, bright red; internodes 0.5–10cm, branches arising in pseudowhorls. Leaves regularly spirally arranged. Blade 6–14 x 4–8mm, broadly obovate; apex rounded, sometimes slightly retuse, without a distinct terminal gland; margin flat or very slightly revolute, sub-entire but with widely spaced scales which are sometimes faintly indented; base tapering, glossy bright green above, paler and dull beneath; glabrous or sparsely scaly above, laxly scaly beneath. Scales circular or nearly so; marginal zone relatively broad, mostly about the same diameter as the central region. Mid-vein impressed above, often with a few simple hairs in the proximal area, prominent beneath especially in the proximal ½; lateral veins not visible. Petiole to 2 x 1mm, shallowly grooved, sub-densely hairy especially above and laxly brown-scaly. Flower buds to 4 x 2mm, ovoid or ellipsoid, brown. Outer bracts subulate, erect, densely scaly outside, inner ones broadly ovate, with a few scales distally outside but with numerous semi-erect hairs and densely fringed with white hairs, obtuse or slightly apiculate, with dark brown thickened apices. Flowers solitary, half-hanging or hanging. Pedicels 3–5mm, green, densely hairy with spreading hairs, or hairy and scaly or exclusively scaly. Calyx disc-shaped, densely covered with long patent hairs. Corolla scaly, but without hairs outside, 10–15mm, red or orange, sometimes with a yellow tube. Ovary exclusively scaly.
