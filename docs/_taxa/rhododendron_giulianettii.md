## Description
Shrub to 3m. Twigs c.1.5mm in diameter, slender, densely covered with shortly stalked scales in the younger parts, rough with the stalks after the scales have gone and with conspicuous rounded lateral buds. Leaves spreading, spiral, mostly at the upper 1⁄3 of the internodes which are 2–8cm apart. Blade 15–20 x 7–12mm, glossy dark green above, brown beneath, elliptic to ovate-­elliptic, sometimes nearly rounded; apex broadly tapering, obtuse to rounded, not apiculate; margin slightly revolute; base rounded, abruptly contracted, densely scaly on both sides initially, early glabrescent above, the flat scales leaving small, shallow pits on the upper surface, very densely overlapping, brown-scaly beneath. Scales translucent or pale brown, with broad lobed flanges and small impressed centres; scattered at fairly regular intervals are much larger, darker brown scales, with large swollen centres which gives the underside of the leaf a spotted appearance. Mid-vein narrowly impressed above, moderately to strongly raised beneath; lateral veins 2–3 per side, spreading, irregular, indistinctly anastomosing, slightly depressed above, obscure below. Petiole 2–3 x c.1mm, flattened, and somewhat winged by the decurrent blade in the distal ½, grooved above, scaly. Flower buds to 10 x 7mm, deep red, broadly ovoid, the tips and margins appressed. Bracts to 10 x 7mm, ovate, obtuse, outer ones scaly outside, inner ones larger, glabrous, not hairy. Bracteoles to 10mm, filiform, glabrous. Inflorescence 1–4-flowered, the flowers held horizontally. Pedicels 10–14mm, thick, densely brown-scaly. Calyx 3–4mm in diameter, obliquely disc-shaped, the margin wavy, densely scaly outside. Corolla 28–35 x 15–18mm, red, completely glabrous both outside and inside; tube 20–25 x 4–5 x 7–10mm, cylindrical, straight, flaring slightly at the mouth; lobes c.10 x 10mm, nearly circular, spreading, often retuse. Stamens 25–30mm, unequal; filaments linear, but dilated below, glabrous; anthers 2.6–3 x c.1mm. Disc glabrous. Ovary 5 x 2.5mm, conical, densely shortly patently hairy and scaly, gradually tapering distally; style c.24mm, thick, glabrous except for scales at the base; stigma broad-conical, the lobes inconspicuous.
