Scales remotely spaced on both sides, flat, thin with a broad lobed margin and small central area. Mid-vein impressed above, slightly raised below; lateral veins 4–7 per side curving upwards towards the margin, raised both above and below, reticulation obscure above, below slightly raised, the leaf surface often furrowed. Petiole 2–7mm, with sub-persistent scales. Bracts to 14 x 2mm, with scaly margins, the outer ovate, c.5 x 5mm, the apex mucronate, the internal bracts sub-linear, apex rounded. Inflorescence of 5–8, half-hanging flowers in an open umbel. Pedicels 8–15 x 0.4–0.9mm, covered with scales and simple hairs. Calyx c.1.8mm in diameter, obliquely disc-shaped, weakly 5-lobed, with scales and hairs outside, inside glabrous. Corolla pink, tubular, expanded distally but contracted shortly below the mouth; tube 53–78 x 4.3–8.2 x 3.5–7.5mm, curved, outside sparsely scaly, inside covered with short hairs especially proximally; lobes 7.5–10.5mm, spreading, apex rounded to weakly retuse. Stamens clustered together; filaments 65–76mm, densely covered with white hairs in the proximal ½; anthers 2.6–3.5mm, exserted to c.10mm. Disc covered with hairs.
