Blade 35–60 x 15–30mm, obovate or obovate-elliptic; apex obtuse to rounded, often apiculate by a small protruding gland; margin entire, recurved when dry; base broadly tapering to truncate-rounded or sub-cordate, shining and brownish-green above, dull and paler beneath. Scales lax to sub-dense, small, rounded, and slightly immersed on both sides in fully mature leaves. Mid-vein strongly impressed above, distinctly raised beneath; lateral veins 6–10 per side, straight, arching inwards near the margin, very slightly impressed above, prominent beneath, reticulation inconspicuous or very slightly impressed above, dense and clearly raised beneath. Petiole 4–7 x c.1.5mm, grooved above, densely scaly. Bracts to 15mm, ovate to obovate, outer ones acuminate, inner ones obtuse, scaly outside, glabrous inside. Bracteoles 10–15mm, filiform to linear-spathulate, glabrous. Inflorescence a 5–8-flowered umbel. Pedicels 6–15mm, slender, densely scaly. Calyx small, shortly and irregularly 5-toothed. Corolla trumpet-shaped, white; tube 33–55 x 5–6 x 6–7mm, narrowly-cylindrical, straight or slightly curved, pouched at the base, densely covered with small rounded scales outside, glabrous inside; lobes 10–14 x 6–10mm, obovate, obtuse, scaly outside. Stamens unequal; filaments 35–40mm, linear, laxly to very laxly hairy; anthers 3 x 1mm, oblong. Disc glabrous or almost so. Ovary 6–7 x 1.5mm, sub-cylindrical, 5-ribbed, very densely scaly; style 27–35mm, slender, becoming exserted from the mouth, with spreading hairs and scales proximally, then exclusively hairy, the distal part glabrous; stigma obconical.
