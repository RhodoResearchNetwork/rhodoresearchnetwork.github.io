## Description
Shrub. Twigs rounded, 2.5–4mm in diameter, densely scaly when young, becoming glabrescent; internodes 2.8–9cm. Leaves 4–7 together in pseudowhorls. Blade 70–105 x 28–44mm, elliptic-ovate; apex gradually acuminate, broadly acute; margin flat or weakly revolute; base rounded; initially densely scaly on both sides, glabrescent above at maturity, persistently and sub-densely scaly beneath. Scales flat, small marginal zone irregularly lobed; centre slightly impressed. Mid-vein broad proximally, flat above, strongly raised beneath; lateral veins 8–12 per side, spreading, straight at the base, curved upwards and arching inwards distally; a little raised above, more distinctly so beneath, reticulation indistinct above, densely and minutely prominent beneath. Petiole 6–12 x 1.5–2mm. Bracts to 30 x 15mm, circular to broadly ovate-acuminate, scaly and shortly hairy near the base outside, scaly on the margins, becoming glabrescent but remaining a little rough. Inflorescence a 6-flowered umbel. Pedicels 12–16mm, thick, sub-densely scaly, without hairs. Calyx c.3mm in diameter, inconspicuous, disc-shaped, oblique. Corolla tubular below, funnel-shaped distally, white; tube 26–31 x 4–5 x 5–6mm, strongly 5-lobed at the base, glabrous outside, hairy inside; lobes c.15 x 12–13mm, obovate, half-spreading. Stamens somewhat exserted; filaments linear, densely hairy in the proximal 2⁄3, glabrous distally; anthers c.3 x 1mm, oblong, base obtuse. Disc glabrous below but with short white hairs on the upper margin. Ovary c.9 x 2mm, cylindrical-conical, 5-angled, appressed-hairy, the hairs covering scales, gradually tapering distally; style c.20mm, densely hairy and laxly scaly in the proximal 2⁄3, glabrous distally; stigma large, 5-lobed.
