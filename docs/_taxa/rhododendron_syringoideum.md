## Description
Shrub to 2m. Twigs to 5mm in diameter, obtusely angular or laterally compressed, densely brown, stellate-scaly; internodes 5–12cm. Leaves 5–6 together in loose pseudowhorls or laxly arranged in the upper 1⁄3 of the internodes. Blade 60–90 x 40–60mm, broadly elliptic or sub-ovate-elliptic; apex broadly obtuse to rounded, sometimes slightly retuse; margin entire, narrowly revolute, especially proximally; base broadly tapering to rounded, or sub-cordate, laxly covered with reddish-brown scales on both sides initially. Scales very variable in size, stellate to sub-dendroid, each on top of minute epidermal tubercles. Mid-vein thick and prominent, grooved proximally, gradually becoming flat distally above, strongly raised below, gradually less so distally; lateral veins 7–8 per side, irregular, some deeply forked, indistinctly anastomosing before the margin, smooth when fresh, slightly impressed above, prominent below when dry, reticulation obscure. Petiole 10–20 x c.2mm, weakly grooved above, densely brown-scaly. Outer bracts ovate to sub-circular, to 20 x 20mm, inner ones to 35 x 18mm, spathulate, innermost ones elongate-spathulate, to 50 x 10mm, all laxly short-hairy outside, internally more densely and longer, appressed hairy. Bracteoles 40–50 x 2–5mm, sub-spathulate-linear, hairy especially along the margin. Inflorescence an 8–14-flowered open umbel. Pedicels 5–7 x 1.5–2mm, laxly scaly. Calyx c.5mm in diameter, oblique, rim-like, obscurely lobed. Corolla 100–110 x 55mm, trumpet-shaped, pink, strongly scented, weakly zygomorphic; tube 85–105 x 6–9 x 10–15mm, sub-densely scaly outside, hairy for ¾ of the tube inside, straight or slightly curved, strongly angled in the proximal ½, gradually widening for the proximal 65mm, (where curved), then parallel for the remainder; lobes 26–27 x 24–25mm, spreading, oblong-­obovate, in two groups: three upper overlapping to 2/3; two lower, widely separated from the upper three, overlapping 1⁄3–½. Stamens exserted to 15mm, grouped on the lower side of the mouth, becoming reflexed back against the corolla lobes with age; filaments linear, hairy for c.¾ proximally, narrower and glabrous distally; anthers 5–6 x 1–1.3mm, narrowly oblong, base of each cell apiculate. Disc glabrous. Ovary 12–15 x c.3mm, elongate-cylindrical, densely covered with white or yellowish appressed hairs, which cover the scales, tapering distally; style exserted to 15mm, pink, densely covered with hairs and scales proximally, becoming less hairy and more scaly, glabrous for the distal 10mm; stigma c.1.5mm in diameter, 5-lobed, green. Fruit to 50 x 7mm.
