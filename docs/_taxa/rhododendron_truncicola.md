## Description
Small shrub. Twigs slender, 1.5–2.5mm in diameter, scaly at the tips at first, otherwise minutely rough from the scale bases; internodes 2–4cm. Leaves 3–4 together in pseudowhorls at the upper nodes. Blade 30–45 x 16–27mm, elliptic or broadly elliptic; apex obtuse to rounded, occasionally minutely retuse; margin entire, narrowly revolute; base broadly tapering to truncate or rounded, above glabrescent or with the remains of scales and with minute tubercles; below more persistently scaly especially along the mid-vein. Scales stellate, sub-sessile on top of pale persistent epidermal tubercles. Mid-vein flat or slightly impressed above, slightly prominent beneath especially towards the base of the blade, much more slender than the petiole; lateral veins c.6 per side, irregular, straight below, anastomosing with each other before the margin, forming a lax network which is equally raised on both sides when dry, thick, rigid and rough to the touch. Petiole 7–10 x c.3mm, pale cream, weakly grooved above, densely scaly. Flower buds 20 x 11mm, pale-green, ellipsoid, the margins of the bracts tightly appressed but the bract tips ‘hooded’ with the apex of the ‘hood’ standing out so that the bud has a lumpy appearance. Bracts to 15 x 6mm, ovate to spathulate, the margins only with brown dendroid scales otherwise glabrous, apiculate. Bracteoles to 15mm, filiform with a few long translucent cilia along the edges sometimes with a reduced dendroid scale on the top. Inflorescence a c.3-flowered umbel, the flowers half-hanging except where held by the leaves into horizontal or semi-erect positions. Pedicels 10–15 x c.0.6mm, pink, densely brown stellate-scaly, without hairs. Calyx disc-shaped, hardly lobed, c.2.5mm in diameter, densely scaly and sparsely hairy outside, sparsely ciliate on the margin. Corolla 30–35 x 29mm, zygomorphic, tubular, pink; tube 20–25 x 5–10 x 10–13mm, curved, laxly scaly outside, with a few white hairs within; lobes 10–15 x 10–15mm, broadly obovate-spathulate, half overlapping except not or hardly overlapping between the upper 3 and the lower 2, with a few sparse scales outside. Stamens at first tightly clustered on the upper side of the flower, exserted to 5mm, later to 10mm and becoming irregularly arranged, (sometimes with 12 stamens); filaments linear, laxly patent-hairy below, glabrous in the upper 1⁄3; anthers c.2.5 x 1mm, dark purple, broadly oblong, the cells very shortly apiculate at the base. Disc glabrous below, hairy at the upper margin. Ovary c.4 x 1.8mm, cylindrical, densely scaly and laxly hairy, abruptly contracted distally; style held on upper side of the tube, below the anthers on opening, laxly patently hairy and densely scaly in the lower 1⁄3, glabrous distally; stigma thickly conical-globose, becoming exserted beyond the anthers to c.15mm.
