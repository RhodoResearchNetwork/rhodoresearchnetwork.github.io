## Description
Shrub to 1.5m. Twigs 1.5–2.5mm in diameter, sparsely scaly to almost glabrous; internodes 2–10cm. Leaves 3–5 together in tight pseudowhorls. Blade 56–80 x 7–14mm, narrowly elliptic to almost linear; apex acute; margin entire, slightly revolute in the proximal ½; base narrowly tapering; glabrescent above, laxly scaly beneath. Scales small, deeply, irregularly and broadly lobed in the marginal zone; centre minute, slightly or not impressed. Mid-vein slightly impressed above in the proximal ½, very slightly raised below throughout its length; lateral veins 4–6 per side, diverging at an acute angle, the whole leaf smooth with obscure reticulation when fresh, becoming more prominent when dry. Petiole 1–2 x c.2.5mm, indistinctly grooved above and with a few pale brown scales. Flower buds c.25 x 15mm, narrowly ovoid, acute. Bracts to 28 x 10mm, translucent red or pink, ovate, long-acuminate, the apex tapering to a 2–3mm long acute point, glabrous outside. Bracteoles to 15mm, subulate, glabrous. Inflorescence an irregular open umbel of 2–5 flowers which are semi-erect to half-hanging. Pedicels 10–13 x 1.5–1.6mm, laxly scaly and sparsely covered in spreading white hairs. Calyx a low ring, with sparse scales. Corolla 30–35 x 25mm, funnel-shaped, lobed to halfway, glossy orange or red; tube 16–17 x 6–8 x 11–14mm, straight, glabrous inside and out; lobes 12–15 x 10–12mm, sub-erect, strongly overlapping for most of their length, obovate-sub-spathulate. Stamens c.20mm, arranged regu­larly all round the mouth, not exserted; filaments linear, dilated and laxly hairy in the lower ¼, glabrous and narrower distally; anthers 4.5 x 1.25mm, elongate-oblong, each cell shortly pointed at the base. Disc prominent, glabrous. Ovary 7 x 3mm, conical, densely white-hairy and with some small brown scales; style 8mm, glabrous; stigma 1.5mm in diameter. Fruit 10 x 6mm, ovoid- cylindrical, densely hairy and scaly.
