## Description
Shrub to 2m. Twigs slender, densely scaly, early glabrescent and often whitish; internodes 6–16cm. Leaves 3–4 together in pseudowhorls at the upper 2 or 3 nodes. Blade 70–140 x 30–55mm, broadly elliptic or elliptic or slightly obovate; apex broadly acute to obtuse; margin entire, flat, a little recurved when dry; base broadly tapering to rounded, young leaves densely reddish-brown stellate-scaly, mature ones glabrescent, on both sides covered with numerous epidermal tubercles which make them feel rough to the touch. Scales dendroid; marginal zone divided to, or almost to, the centre; centre small, deepened or prolonged into a short stalk. Mid-vein slightly prominent proximally above, gradually becoming flat in the distal part above; below as thick as the petiole in the proximal part, gradually decreasing distally; lateral veins 8–12 per side, irregular, inarched before the margin, slightly prominent on both sides, veins laxly reticulate, not very conspicuous. Petiole 10–15 x 2–2.5mm, densely scaly initially. Bracts 10–35 x 10–15mm, dull red; outer ones ovate, inner ones elliptic-ovate and apiculate, innermost ones broadly spathulate, scaly and/or appressed-hairy. Bract­eoles c.20 x 1–2mm, linear, glabrous. Inflorescence a 3–6-flowered open umbel, the flowers held stiffly horizontally or half-hanging. Pedicels 10–15 x 1.5mm, very densely brown stellate-scaly, without hairs. Calyx c.3mm in diameter, obliquely disc-shaped. Corolla 50–70 x c.70mm, pure white, or pink with darker pink edges, with a scent of carnations; tube 25–40 x 6–10 x 12–15mm, tubular, straight, glabrous outside, shortly hairy inside; lobes 6–7 in number, 20–35 x 20–30mm, spathulate, 3 or 4 of them generally smaller than the others, horizontally spreading. Stamens exserted to c.10mm; filaments linear, densely or more laxly hairy in the proximal ¾, glabrous distally; anthers 3.5–4 x c.1mm, elongate-oblong, the base obtuse. Disc glabrous below, hairy at the upper margin. Ovary 8–10 x 2–3mm, sub-cylindrical, covered with whitish to yellowish, distally directed hairs, which cover the scales, tapering gradually; style c.30mm, slender, densely hairy proximally, the hairs becoming laxer distally and completely glabrous in the uppermost ¼, without scales; stigma 2.5–3mm.
