## Description
Shrub or small tree to 6.5m. Twigs 2–4mm in diameter, rounded, sub-densely to laxly scaly, quickly glabrescent; internodes 1–10cm. Leaves 3–5 together in tight pseudo­whorls. Blade 50–90 x 30–50mm, broadly elliptic, occasionally sub-obovate; apex acute to rounded or sometimes minutely emarginate, with a small pale gland which rarely slightly protrudes; margin entire, flat or weakly revolute; base broadly tapering to rounded; laxly scaly and quickly glabrescent above; sub-densely and more persistently brown-scaly below. Scales round or weakly lobed with a broad flange and relatively small centre, impressed. Mid-vein impressed above in the proximal ½, smooth distally; below raised proximally, gradually becoming less so and finally smooth in the distal ¼; lateral veins 5–9 per side, minutely impressed above, smooth below, looping and joining before the margin, reticulation loose and weak, more clearly visible beneath. Petiole 10–20 x 2–3mm, distinctly grooved above, especially distally, densely brown scaly. Inflorescence a 2–6-flowered open umbel, the flowers mostly semi-erect. Pedicels 10–40 x c.1.5mm, scaly often more densely so distally. Calyx a disc or 5-lobed up to 8 x 3.5mm, pink. Corolla 25–55 x 35–45mm, red or pink, without scent; tube 25–40 x 7–11 x 10–20mm, scaly outside, glabrous inside; lobes 15–20 x 15–22mm, spreading horizontally, to slightly reflexed, overlapping ½–2⁄3. Stamens loosely clustered on the upper side of the mouth, not or hardly exserted, slightly dimorphic; filaments 22–31 and 21–30mm, glabrous; anthers c.2mm, oblong, pale brown. Disc green, glabrous or hairy. Ovary 3.5–5 x 2–3mm, sub-cylindrical, tapering distally, densely scaly and sometimes hairy; style scaly and sometimes hairy as well in the proximal 1⁄3–½, glabrous distally, held on the upper side of the tube; stigma rounded. Fruit 20–25 x 4–5mm, fusiform. Seeds 2.5–3mm, including the tails.
