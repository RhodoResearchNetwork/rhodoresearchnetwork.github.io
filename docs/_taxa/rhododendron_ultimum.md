## Description
Prostrate shrub to 10cm. Twigs c.2mm in diameter, often pale and sub-densely covered with sub-stellate scales when young, later, glabrescent but with numerous thick cushions of leaf bases remaining; internodes 2.5–6cm. Leaves densely spirally arranged, of a distinctive purple-colour. Blade 18–27 x 10–19mm, broadly elliptic to elliptic-obovate; apex rounded, with a small protruding apical gland; margin minutely crenulate and weakly revolute; base broadly tapering; laxly to sub-densely scaly initially on both sides, early glabrescent above, persistently scaly beneath. Scales small, flat, sub-circular, marginal zone large, thin, variously angled, sub-stellate or crenate; centre small, dark, faintly impressed. Mid-vein slightly impressed above, broad and obtusely prominent beneath in the proximal part; lateral veins inconspicuous. Petiole 2–4 x 1–2mm, rounded or somewhat flattened. Outer bracts 10–15mm, ovate, inner ones to 20–25 x 8–15mm, obovate to spathulate, apex shortly acuminate, or obtuse, membranous, entirely glabrous. Bracteoles to 18 x 1mm, linear, glabrous. Inflorescence 2–4-flowered, flowers half-hanging. Pedicels 12–15 x 0.8mm, densely sub-stellately scaly, without hairs. Calyx c.3mm in diameter, obliquely disc-shaped, obscurely lobed, scaly outside. Corolla 35–45mm, funnel-shaped, bright orange, fleshy; tube 20–30 x c.5 x 9–10mm, straight, glabrous on both sides; lobes 14–17 x 12–15mm, broadly obovate to sub-circular, semi-erect. Stamens exserted to c.6mm, unequal; filaments linear, glabrous; anthers c.2.8–3 x 1.3–1.5mm, obovate-oblong, each cell ending in a short basal apic­ulus. Disc prominent, glabrous. Ovary c.6 x 2.5mm, sub-cylindrical, densely sub-stellately scaly, tapering distally; style scaly at the base, glabrous distally, slightly longer than the stamens; stigma shortly obconical.
