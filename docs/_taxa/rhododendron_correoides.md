## Description
Shrub with erect branches, to 4m. Twigs round to angular, at first densely covered with scales, which give a grey appearance; internodes 1–8cm often with conspicuous rounded lateral buds. Leaves either scattered in loose, or crowded in distinct 5–7-leafed, pseudowhorls. Blade 20–35 x 8–17mm, elliptic or sub-obovate, rarely ovate-elliptic; apex broadly obtusely tapering, sometimes rounded, apiculate with a small terminal gland; margin thickened and crenulate by impressed scales; base very broadly tapering to rounded, densely scaly initially on both sides, glabrescent later above and then with a pitted surface; very densely and more persistently scaly beneath. Scales overlapping with broad transparent, lobed marginal zones which eventually disappear and small to moderately sized centres which are impressed, leaving pits. Mid-vein slightly impressed above, bluntly raised beneath especially in the proximal part, disappearing distally, or sometimes entirely inconspicuous; lateral veins 3–5 per side, curved-ascending, faintly impressed or often obscure above, indistinct beneath. Petiole 3–12 x c.2mm, semi-rounded, grooved above, densely scaly. Buds 15–20 x 8–11mm, narrowly ovate with a slender acute apex and with spreading tips. Bracts to 20 x 10mm; outer bracts ovate-acuminate, sub-acute with a few scales outside near the midline and margins, glabrous elsewhere but often with a greyish waxy deposit; inner ones narrowly ovate to obovate-spathulate, membranous and shiny, glabrous. Bracteoles 10–15mm, linear-sub-­spathulate, glabrous. Inflorescence an open, 3–5-flowered umbel, the flowers hanging vertically, occasionally half-hanging. Pedicels 10–20 x c.1mm, very densely scaly, without hairs, forming an angle with the calyx. Calyx 2.5–3mm in diameter, very shortly cup-shaped, oblique, densely scaly outside, obscurely lobed. Corolla 20–32 x 20–25mm, tubular below, slightly dilated distally, yellow or orange, without scent; tube 12–22 x 4–8 x 6–12mm, sub-densely or laxly scaly outside, glabrous inside; lobes 6–11 x 8–9mm, broadly elliptic to sub-circular, semi-erect, overlapping to halfway, scaly outside away from the margins. Stamens unequal, irregularly clustered around the mouth of the flower; filaments linear, glabrous; anthers 2–2.5 x 1.3–2mm, broadly obovate-oblong. Disc glabrous. Ovary c.4 x 2.5–3mm, conical, densely scaly; style thick, scaly at the very base, glabrous otherwise, as long as the corolla, becoming exserted; stigma thick, 5-lobed. Fruit c.15–20 x 4–5mm, sub-cylindrical, apex long-­tapering, base shortly tapering, becoming erect before maturity. Seeds 4–4.8mm, without tails 1mm, the longest tail c.2.1mm, one tail often much broader than the other.
