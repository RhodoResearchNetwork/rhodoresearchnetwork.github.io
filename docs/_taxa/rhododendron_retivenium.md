## Description
Shrub or small tree to 6m. Twigs 3–5mm in diameter, rounded, smooth, green or reddish, covered in flat brown scales; internodes 3–12cm. Leaves spirally arranged or weakly arranged in very loose pseudowhorls. Blade 110–160 x 30–50mm, narrowly elliptic; apex acutely pointed; margin entire and flat but strongly rolled back in young expanding leaves; base tapering, often shortly truncate, glabrescent and indistinctly dark punctate above, laxly and persistently scaly beneath. Scales minute, shallowly lobed to sub-circular with a broad marginal zone and small centre, weakly impressed. Mid-vein slightly raised above proximally but then becoming slightly impressed, raised below throughout its length; lateral veins numerous, slender, smooth or slightly raised in dried specimens, reticulation obscure when fresh, dense, fine, but prominent on both sides when dry. Petiole 10–20 x 4–5mm, not grooved, green or red, scaly. Flower buds ovoid, to 30 x 15mm. Outer bracts to 30 x 12mm, ovate, inner ones broadly ovate-oblong, innermost spathulate, obtuse, membranous, all glabrous apart from sparse marginal scales. Bracteoles c.20 x 1mm, linear, glabrous. Inflorescence 4–7-flowered in an open umbel, the flowers held horizontally. Pedicels 22–32 x 2mm, red or green, sparsely scaly, not hairy. Calyx 4–5mm in diameter, obliquely disc-shaped, the margin wavy and indistinctly 5-lobed, glabrous. Corolla 30–64 x 35–75mm, clear yellow or yellow flushed with orange, usually strongly and sweetly scented; tube 14–34 x 8 x 20mm, funnel-shaped, straight, with a few scattered scales outside, densely short-hairy inside proximally; lobes 20–37 x 21–36mm, broadly obovate to sub-circular, half-spreading, overlapping up to ¾. Stamens loosely and irregularly arranged on the lower side of the flower, sometimes in two groups on each side, exserted up to 10mm; filaments c.35mm, hairy in the lower 1⁄3; anthers 4–5 x 1mm, yellow or purple, curved, minutely apiculate. Disc thick and prominent, glabrous, or occasionally shortly hairy at the upper margin. Ovary 8–10 x 2–3mm, cylindrical, tapering gradually distally, appearing glabrous, but laxly finely and very shortly hairy and with some sparse scales; style 20–25mm, glabrous or slightly (and minutely) hairy at the very base; stigma c.5mm in diameter, yellow or turning red with age. Fruit 52 x 9mm, cylindrical but tapering at each end. Seeds 5mm, without tails 1mm, the longest tail 2mm.
