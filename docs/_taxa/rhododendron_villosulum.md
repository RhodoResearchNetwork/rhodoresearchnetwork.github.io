## Description
Erect shrub to c.1m. Twigs rounded, 2–4mm in diam­eter, at first rough with fragile, brown stellate scales, quickly glabrescent and smooth; internodes 4–16cm. Leaves 3–5 together in tight pseudowhorls, often with 1 or 2 much smaller leaves. Blade 40–70 x 25–40mm, ovate or broadly elliptic; apex shortly to long acuminate, characteristically decurved, obtuse to acute; apex often slightly mucron­ate with the protruding mid-vein; margin entire, broadly recurved; base broadly tapering to rounded; glabrescent above at maturity; persistently and sub-densely scaly beneath. Scales flat, marginal zone variously and irregularly sub-stellately lobed; centre dark, slightly impressed. Mid-vein narrow, strongly impressed above, strong and very prominent beneath; lateral veins 4–8 per side, irregular, spreading and anastomosing, faintly or not impressed above and weakly raised beneath, reticulation dense and prominent on both sides. Petiole 5–7 x 2–3mm, grooved above, densely scaly, held at 45° to the stem. Flower buds to 25 x 14mm, ovoid, smooth with the bract tips appressed, pale green or pink; outer bracts broadly ovate, apex shortly subulate or apiculate, with a few scales along the midline near the apex and along the margins otherwise glabrous; inner ones to 25 x 10mm, ovate to obovate-spathulate, obtuse, densely appressed-hairy outside, the innermost narrowly spathulate. Bract­eoles to 20 x 1mm, linear, hairy throughout and with a few scales at the apex. Inflorescence 2–5 flowers in an open umbel, half-hanging to hanging. Pedicels 12–29 x 1.25–2mm, red, densely patently hairy and sparsely scaly. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, disc-shaped, obliquely 5- angular, densely hairy. Corolla 35–40 x 35–40mm, tubular below, expanded distally, oblique, dark to light red, without scent; tube 20–26 x 7–8 x 10–13mm, curved, laxly to densely, shortly patently hairy all over, outside and at the base inside; lobes 15–16 x 14–18mm, sub-circular, slightly retuse, spreading horizontally, overlapping ½–2⁄3, hairy outside in the basal central region. Stamens tightly clustered on the upper side of the mouth, exserted to 8mm; filaments red, filiform, hairy in the proximal 1⁄3–½; anthers 2–3 x 1–1.5mm, brown. Disc densely hairy at the upper margin only. Ovary 5–6 x 2.5–3mm, sub-ovoid-cylindrical, densely patently white hairy, the hairs covering scales, gradually tapering distally; style white patent-hairy almost to the top, without scales, held on the upper side of the corolla tube; stigma broad, distinctly lobed. Fruit 25–35 x 4–5mm, fusiform, persistently hairy. Seeds 5mm, without tails 0.9mm, the longest tail 2.4mm.
