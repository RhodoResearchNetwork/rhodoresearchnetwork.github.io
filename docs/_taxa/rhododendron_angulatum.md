Shrub to c.75cm. Twigs robust, rounded, laxly scaly. Leaves c.5 in pseudowhorls. Blade 110–180 x 35–58mm, ovate-elliptic; apex gradually long-acuminate, acute; margin flat or weakly recurved; base obtuse, rounded or slightly cordate; glabrescent above with age, sub-densely scaly beneath. Scales stellately lobed in the marginal zone; centre impressed, leaving minute pits when scales are gone. Mid-vein narrowly grooved above, thick and obtusely prominent beneath in the proximal part; lateral veins 12–15 per side, ascending, anastomosing, very slightly raised or impressed above, obscure beneath; reticu­lation obscure. Petiole 10–12 x 3mm, strong, grooved above, flattened, transversely rugulose, minutely scaly. Inflorescence of c.6 flowers. Pedicels 40–50 x c.2.5mm in diameter, laxly minutely scaly, more densely so below the calyx, without hairs. Calyx c.4.5mm in diameter, oblique, obtusely and inconspicuously 5-angular, ciliate. Corolla 55–66mm, funnel-shaped, lobed in the upper 2⁄3, red, fleshy; tube c.20 x 8 x 9mm, sparsely minutely scaly outside, laxly hairy inside, distinctly 5-angular or pouched at the base outside, deeply 5-grooved lengthwise in the proximal part inside, the ribs extending upwards to the middle of the corolla lobes; lobes 35–40 x c.20mm, sub-ovate-elliptic, obtuse, spreading. Stamens nearly as long as the corolla; filaments linear and shortly patently hairy below, narrower and glabrous distally; anthers 5.5–6 x c.1mm, linear-oblong, obtuse at the base. Disc promi­nent, practically glabrous. Ovary c.10 x 3mm, conical-cylindrical, densely covered with thick, nearly round, scales, no hairs, tapering distally; style c.48mm, scaly and sparsely minutely hairy, or nearly papillose, at the base, glabrous distally; stigma thick-rounded.
