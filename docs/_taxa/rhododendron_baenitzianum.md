## Description
Shrub to 2m. Twigs 3–6mm in diameter, rounded, densely sub-stellately scaly at first, becoming glabrescent; internodes 3–10cm. Leaves 5–10 in tight pseudo­whorls, sub-sessile or shortly petioled. Blade 120–250 x 30–85mm, elliptic to ovate-elliptic; apex sub-caudate-acuminate or acute; margin flat; base obtusely or broadly acutely tapering, rarely rounded, often unequal, glabrescent above at maturity; laxly scaly beneath. Scales small, flat, marginal zone irregularly lobed; centre small, weakly or not impressed, finally glabrescent beneath and then with dark spots. Mid-vein narrow and impressed above, broader and bluntly prominent beneath; lateral veins 8–12 per side, ascending, curved-anastomosing before the margin, the major veins distinctly grooved above, prominent beneath, reticulation finely raised on both sides. Peti­ole 3–4 x 2–3mm, semi-rounded, grooved above, scaly. Bracts to 25 x 10mm; outer bracts ovate to obovate, cuspidate or shortly acutely acuminate, laxly scaly outside and on the margins, shortly appressed hairy in the middle or towards the apex; inner bracts sub-spathulate, acuminate, laxly scaly outside, but not hairy. Bracteoles to 20mm, filiform to linear-sub-spathulate, sub-glabrous. Inflorescence 4–15-flowered, in a complete umbel. Pedicels 25–55 x c.1.5mm, laxly scaly especially at base and apex, without hairs. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, sub-oblique, rim-like. Corolla 75–100mm, funnel-shaped, yellow with orange or pink lobes; tube 50–60 x 6–8 x 20–25mm, pouched at the base, laxly scaly outside, shortly hairy inside; lobes 30–40 x 25–30mm, spreading, broadly obovate to sub-circular. Stamens sub-equal, exserted to c.15mm; filaments linear, shortly patently hairy in the proximal ½, glabrous distally; anthers c.4 x 1.2mm, oblong. Disc hairy on the upper margin, glabrous below. Ovary 10–12 x 2–2.5mm, sub-cylindrical, shortly and densely covered with distally pointing hairs and with scales, tapering gradually distally; style equalling the stamens when receptive, densely covered with sub-patent hairs and with scales to near the top; stigma thick, 5-lobed. Fruit 150–200 x 4–5mm, elong­ate-fusiform, often curved, laxly hairy and scaly.
