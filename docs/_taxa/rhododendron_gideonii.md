## Description
Shrub to 1.5m. Twigs rounded, sub-densely scaly when young, glabrescent and whitish later; internodes 5–9cm. Leaves 2–4 together in tight pseudowhorls. Blade 35–60 x 14–25mm, elliptic or very slightly obovate- elliptic; apex broadly acute to obtuse; margin narrowly revolute; base broadly to narrowly tapering; sub-densely scaly when young, though quickly glabrescent above, persistently impressed-scaly beneath. Scales rounded, brown, dome-shaped with a narrow marginal zone, impressed and surrounded by transparent depressions. Mid-vein slightly grooved above, strong and prominent beneath; lateral veins 1–4 per side, obscure, slightly curved, parallel to each other, smooth, reticulation obscure. Petiole 2–5 x 1–3mm, semi-circular in section, grooved above, scaly. Bracts broadly ovate, fringed with scales and with a few scales on the outer surface near the tip, especially along the median line, otherwise glabrous. Bracteoles to 10mm, narrowly linear. Inflorescence a 5–8-flowered umbel. Pedicels to 7 x 0.5mm, slender, sparsely scaly. Calyx very small, disc-shaped, sub-entire, moderately scaly. Corolla 30–35 x 11mm, trumpet-shaped, white; tube 28 x 3.5 x 4mm, straight or very slightly curved, almost parallel sided, densely scaly outside, hairy and with a few scales inside near the base; lobes 5 x 4mm, spreading, circular to elliptic, with a few scales outside, glabrous inside. Stamens exserted to c.5mm; filaments slender, sparsely and patently hairy in the proximal 1⁄3 only, glabrous distally; anthers c.1.5 x 0.7mm, oblong. Disc hairy on the upper side, otherwise glabrous. Ovary 2.8 x 1.2mm, narrowly cylindrical, moderately hairy with semi-appressed white hairs and very densely scaly, abruptly tapering distally; style exserted from the mouth, laxly hairy and with scattered scales to within 2mm of the stigma, this distal part glabrous; stigma shortly-obconical.
