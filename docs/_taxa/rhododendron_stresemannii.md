## Description
Shrub. Twigs 2–3mm in diameter, rounded, brown, sub-densely covered with appressed scales at first, laxly so later. Leaves 3–5 together in pseudowhorls. Blade 85–100 x 42–53mm, ovate- or elliptic; apex shortly acutely acuminate; margin flat; base cordate with rounded lobes; glabrescent above when mature and then covered with minute black pits, laxly to sub-densely scaly beneath. Scales small, marginal zone sub-stellately lobed; centre impressed, finally glabrescent beneath also, leaving dark pitted spots. Mid-vein flat, broad proximally, narrower and slightly impressed for the distal 1⁄3 above; below as large as the petiole proximally, obtusely prominent; lateral veins 7–8 per side, spreading, arching inwards before the margin, slightly impressed above and raised beneath, reticulation inconspicuous. Petiole 5–6 x c.2mm, flattened, scaly. Inflorescence c.7-flowered. Pedicels 24–27 x c.1mm, laxly sub-stellately scaly with flat scales and minute white hairs. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, oblique, disc-shaped, obscurely lobed, fleshy, outside scaly and with short, fine hairs. Corolla 40–45mm, tubular-funnel-shaped, slightly oblique, dark-red; tube 20–23 x 5–6 x 12–15mm, glabrous outside, practically so inside, base dilated and 5-lobed; lobes 20–23 x 15–18mm, obovate-spathulate. Stamens sub-equal, 24–28mm; filaments linear, with sparse, long, spreading hairs in the proximal 1⁄3, glabrous distally; anthers c.3 x 1mm, oblong. Disc low, hairy, except for the base. Ovary 6–7 x c.3mm, sub-ovoid-cylindrical, densely covered with white, forwardly directed hairs, which cover small scales, abruptly contracted distally; style c.20mm, thick, hairy at the base; stigma thick, rounded.
