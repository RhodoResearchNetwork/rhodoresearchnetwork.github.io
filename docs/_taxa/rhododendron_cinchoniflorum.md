## Description
Erect shrub. Twigs slender, rounded, tips scaly; internodes 2–11cm. Leaves 4–6 together in tight pseudo­whorls, not aromatic. Blade 30–60 x 30–40mm, ovate-elliptic or mostly elliptic; apex shortly obtusely acuminate, sometimes apiculate with a small gland; margin entire, slightly revolute; base sub-truncate, rounded or cordate, sub-densely scaly above but quickly glabrescent, densely and persistently scaly beneath. Scales nearly round, wavy at the margin, very distinctly impressed, the scale pits becoming blackish with age. Mid-vein impressed above, strongly prominent beneath; lateral veins 3–4 per side, very slightly impressed above in fully mature leaves, somewhat prominent in younger ones, mostly not easily visible, especially beneath, reticulation obscure. Petiole 1.5–3 x 1–1.5mm, scaly, grooved above. Bracts to 10 x 7mm; outer bracts ovate, acute; inner ones obovate, scaly above along the middle line. Bract­eoles c.6 x 1mm, linear. Pedicels 5–8mm, slender, densely reddish-brown scaly. Calyx c.2.5mm in diameter, disc-like, scaly outside, glabrous inside, the margin undulate and shortly 5-lobed, spreading or reflexed at flowering. Corolla 32 x 14mm, (dry), white, trumpet-shaped; tube 25–30 x 2.5–3 x 2.5–3mm, nearly straight, 5-pouched at the base, very densely scaly outside, glabrous inside; lobes 10–12 x 8–9mm, spreading horizontally, obovate-elliptic, sparsely scaly outside, glabrous inside. Stamens unequal, not or slightly exserted from the throat; filaments filiform, laxly hairy; anthers 2–2.5mm, broadly oblong. Disc low, densely white-hairy. Ovary c.4 x 2mm, cylindrical-conical, densely and exclusively scaly, abruptly narrowed to the style, slightly 5-ribbed; style c.23mm, scaly and shortly patently hairy in the proximal 1⁄3, gradually becoming glabrous distally; stigma shortly obconical, minutely crenulate.
