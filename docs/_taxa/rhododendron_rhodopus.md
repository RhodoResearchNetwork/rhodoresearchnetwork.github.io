## Description
Shrub. Twigs 4–5mm in diameter, rounded, laxly sub-stellately scaly when young, quickly glabrescent and often whitish when older; internodes 13–15cm. Leaves mostly 5 in pseudowhorls with some reduced ones on the internodes. Blade 90–160 x 20–45mm, narrowly ovate, sometimes with slightly unequal sides; apex long-acuminate, acute; margin entire, flat or minutely and narrowly revolute; base broadly tapering, glabrescent above, laxly scaly beneath. Scales small, flat, mostly shortly lobed in the marginal zone; centre minute, hardly impressed. Mid-vein broadened above and slightly raised proximally, narrowed and impressed distally, beneath thick and obtusely promi­nent proximally; lateral veins c.8 per side, at an acute angle, high-ascending, indistinctly anastomosing, slightly depressed above, hardly raised beneath. Petiole 15–20 x 2–3mm, laxly scaly, semi-rounded. Bracts to 40 x 20mm. Outer bracts broadly ovate-elliptic, densely and very shortly coarsely hairy outside, glabrous inside. Bracteoles c.20 x 1mm, linear, laxly hairy towards the apex. Inflorescence an 8–9-flowered open umbel. Pedicels 15–20 x c.1mm, laxly scaly, not hairy, pink. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, disc-shaped, wavy, hardly lobed, scaly outside. Corolla 65–70mm, tubular, lobed in the upper 1⁄3, white, scented; tube 40–50 x c.5 x c.8mm, straight, lobed at the base, glabrous outside or with very sparse fragile scales, sub-densely hairy inside; lobes 20–25 x 15–20mm, spreading, sub-circular. Stamens sub-equal, exserted to 10mm; filaments linear hairy in the lower 2⁄3, filiform and glabrous distally; anthers 4–5 x 1.3mm, oblong. Disc glabrous. Ovary c.10 x 2.5mm, cylindrical, yellowish hairy and minutely scaly, gradually narrowed distally; style nearly as long as the corolla tube, yellowish hairy in the lower ¾, without scales, glabrous below the rounded stigma. Fruit (sub-mature) 50–70 x 7–8mm, cylindrical, tapering at the base, mostly curved, shortly yellowish hairy and minutely scaly, with a persistent hairy style.
