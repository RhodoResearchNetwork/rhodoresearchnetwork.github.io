## Description
Tall shrub. Twigs rounded, thick, at first sub-densely scaly, later glabrescent; internodes 6–16cm. Leaves 5–7 together in pseudowhorls, in which 3–4 leaves are normal, the rest much smaller. Blade 40–110 x 20–60mm, ovate to elliptic-ovate, often asymmetrical; apex shortly acuminate, sub-acute; margin entire, sub-revolute proximally; base sub-truncate-rounded or broadly tapering, sometimes sub-cordate, sub-densely scaly on both sides, the scales slowly disappearing above, persistent for a long time beneath. Scales flat, small, the margin irregularly deeply dentate; centre not impressed. Mid-vein slightly depressed above, thickly prominent beneath proximally, less so distally; lateral veins 8–11 per side, slightly curved, irregular, anastomosing with each other before the margin, faintly impressed or raised above, raised beneath, reticulation dense, more visible beneath only. Petiole 4–12 x 1.5–2mm, grooved above, sub-densely scaly. Bracts to 10 x 7mm, ovate to broadly obovate, laxly scaly and with hairs outside. Bracteoles to 15mm, narrowly linear, glabrous or laxly scaly. Inflorescence an 8–15-flowered open umbel. Pedicels 8–11mm, densely scaly, obliquely thickened below the calyx. Calyx small, rim-like, wavy, indistinctly 5-lobed. Corolla trumpet-shaped, pink; tube 45–50 x c.2.5 x 3.5–4.5mm, cylindrical, slightly curved, gradually expanding from the base but then a little constricted below the mouth, laxly to sub-densely scaly outside, densely hairy inside almost to the mouth; lobes 10–12 x 8–12mm, broadly spathulate to nearly circu­lar, laxly scaly outside at the base and in the middle, glabrous inside. Stamens exserted; filaments linear below, filiform above, shortly hairy nearly to the top; anthers 3.5–4 x 1mm, oblong, base obtuse. Disc glabrous below, densely hairy on the upper margin. Ovary 7–8 x c.2mm, cylindrical, gradually tapering distally, densely appressed-hairy and obscurely scaly; style as long as the corolla tube, covered with sub-patent hairs and scales nearly to the top; stigma thick, shortly obconical.
