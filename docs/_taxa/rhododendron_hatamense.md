## Description
Low shrub, to 50cm, branches spreading. Twigs slender, laxly scaly; internodes 0.8–6cm. Leaves 3–6 together in pseudowhorls. Blade 20–60 x 9–30mm, ovate-elliptic to elliptic; apex shortly acuminate or broadly tapering, obtuse, sometimes rounded, or apiculate; margin cartil­aginous, distinctly revolute; base broadly tapering; glabrescent above with age, persistently sub-densely scaly beneath. Scales small, flat, sub-stellate, faintly impressed, eventually glabrescent beneath with only blackish pits remaining. Mid-vein impressed above, prominent beneath; lateral veins 4–6 per side, straight below, looping near the margin, impressed above, distinctly raised beneath, or sub-obscure. Petiole 2–4mm, flat. Bracts to 10 x 5mm, ovate-acuminate, shortly subulate, membranous, glabrous, except for the marginal scales. Bracteoles to 10mm, filiform. Inflorescence 2–6-flowered. Pedicels 10–24mm, slender, densely scaly and patently hairy. Calyx c.3mm in diameter, disc-shaped, often reflexed, obscurely 5-lobed, scaly and hairy outside. Corolla c.25mm, tubular-funnel-shaped, sub-oblique, bright to dark red, waxy and glossy; tube 15 x 4–5 x 5–6mm, sub-cylindrical, laxly hairy, mainly in the proximal ½ outside, or sometimes glabrous, always without scales, laxly patently hairy in the proximal ½ inside; lobes 8 x 12mm, spreading, broadly obovate-spathulate. Stamens exserted to c.5mm; filaments linear, laxly patently hairy above the base to the proximal ¼, glabrous distally; anthers c.2mm, dark purple to almost black, oblong-­obovate. Disc glabrous. Ovary c.5 x 3mm, sub-ovoid, densely, shortly covered with spreading hairs, the hairs covering the scales, tapering distally; style equalling the stamens, hairy nearly to the top; stigma sub-globose.
