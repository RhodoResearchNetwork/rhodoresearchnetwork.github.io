## Description
Shrub to 1.5m. Twigs c.2mm in diameter, rounded, green or red, laxly to sub-densely scaly, older parts glabrescent; internodes 1.5–7cm. Leaves 3–6 together in tight or loose pseudowhorls. Blade 30–70 x 7–20mm, narrowly elliptic, often slightly broader in the distal ½; apex acute or shortly acuminate; margin entire and flat; base narrowly tapering, sometimes shortly obtuse, sub-densely scaly at first on both sides, glabrescent above, scaly for a longer time beneath. Scales small, irregularly lobed and with minute, dark centres, shallowly impressed. Mid-vein prominent proximally above, smooth proximally for a few millimetres and then narrowly impressed distally; lateral veins 6–8 per side, straight and ascending, indistinctly anastomosing before the margin, very slightly raised on both sides, often indistinct. Petiole 2–6 x 1–2mm, not grooved, flattened with a few scales. Flower buds to 28 x 8mm, pale green, narrowly ovoid, acutely pointed, the bracts mostly appressed, the outermost sometimes slightly spreading, glabrous or with a few marginal scales. Bracts to 22 x 7–9mm, ovate to narrowly ovate, membranous, acute, glabrous and shining. Bract­eoles to 15 x 1mm, linear, glabrous. Inflorescence an open umbel with 3–6 semi-erect to half-hanging flowers. Pedicels 15–25 x c.1.25mm, sparsely scaly or glabrous. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, oblique, rim-like, obtusely angled or very shortly lobed up to 1mm. Corolla 20–25 x 25–32mm, broadly funnel-shaped, sometimes sweetly scented, whitish cream to yellow, pink or red, lobed to halfway; tube 10–12 x 5–6 x 10–12mm, straight, glabrous outside, shortly hairy inside; lobes 13–15 x 11–13mm, spreading, overlapping up to halfway, sub-circular. Stamens irregularly spreading all round the mouth or loosely clustered on the lower side, exserted to 10mm; filaments linear, densely covered with long, spreading, white hairs in the proximal ¼–1⁄3, glabrous distally; anthers 1.5–2 x 1mm, broadly oblong to obovate. Disc prominent, glabrous. Ovary c.4 x 2mm, obovoid-cylindrical, glabrous, abruptly contracted distally; style glabrous, 7–10mm on the lower side of the tube but curving upwards; stigma c.1.5mm, obconical. Fruit 18–22 x c.5mm, sub-cylindrical.
