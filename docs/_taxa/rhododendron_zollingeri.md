## Description
Much-branched, erect shrub or tree, to 4m. Twigs slender, rounded, densely reddish scaly when young; internodes 2–10cm. Leaves 4–6 together in tight pseudo­whorls but commonly with an odd leaf inserted apart from the others. Blade 30–70 x 10–22mm, narrowly ovate to obovate or elliptic or narrowly elliptic; apex shortly acuminate, sub-acute or sometimes obtuse, often apiculate with a small protruding gland; margin flat and entire, or slightly revolute when dry; base broadly to narrowly tapering; initially scaly on both sides, glabrescent above at maturity, the scales leaving small pits; persistently scaly beneath. Scales small, dense to overlapping, pale yellowish-brown, rounded or lobed, marginal zone broad, the centre small and impressed, with occasional much larger scales distributed irregularly. Mid-vein impressed above, prominent beneath, reddish in fresh specimens; lateral veins 5–7 per side, the lower ones steeply ascending, upper ones more spreading, curved, indistinctly anastomosing, faintly impressed above, minutely, but visibly raised beneath. Petiole 2.5–5 x 1–1.5mm, semi-rounded, grooved above, scaly. Bracts to 8 x 4mm, ovate to obovate, obtuse, thin, scaly outside towards the apex, glabrous otherwise. Bracteoles to 6mm, filiform, glabrous. Inflorescence termi­nal but often with some axillary, a 3–8-flowered open umbel, the flowers horizontal to half-hanging. Pedicels 10–15mm, slender, densely scaly. Calyx c.3mm in diameter, cup-shaped, oblique, irregularly 5-lobed, often with 2 narrowly triangular acute lobes, up to 2mm, the other ones smaller, all densely scaly. Corolla 14–15 x 9mm, tubular, red or orange; tube c.10 x 3–6 x 3–5mm, sub-densely scaly outside, glabrous inside, variable in shape, cylindrical or sometimes contracted distally; lobes c.4 x 4mm, sub-circular, scaly outside except near the margins, erect and overlapping to c.¾. Stamens nearly as long as the corolla tube; filaments linear, glabrous; anthers c.1 x 1mm, broadly obtusely obovate. Disc glabrous. Ovary 3–4 x 2–2.5mm, conical, 5-ribbed, densely brown-scaly, abruptly contracted distally; style 4–5mm, glabrous, with a 5-lobed stigma. Fruit 15–18 x 5–6mm, thick-fusiform or sub-cylindrical, sometimes slightly curved in the upper part, densely scaly, the style persistent. Seeds 2.7–3mm, without tails c.0.8mm, the longest tail c.1mm.
