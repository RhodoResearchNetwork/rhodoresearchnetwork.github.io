Scales small, marginal zone irregularly dentate; centre a little impressed. Mid-vein somewhat impressed above, strongly prominent beneath; lateral veins 8–10 per side, irregular, straight below, curved-anastomosing before the margin, slightly impressed above, hardly prominent beneath, smaller veins laxly reticulate, raised beneath only. Petiole 10–15 x c.2mm, grooved above. Bracts to 40 x 18mm, obovate-elliptic, hairy outside in the middle and with longer and appressed hairs in the lower part on both sides. Bracteoles 30–50mm, filiform, hairy. Inflorescence 6–9-flowered. Pedicels c.5mm, thick, scaly. Calyx minute, oblique, circular, obscurely 5-lobed. Corolla 65–70mm, trumpet-shaped; tube 50–60 x c.3 x c.6mm, cylindrical, hardly widened upwards, glabrous outside, densely hairy inside in the proximal ½; lobes c.17 x 14mm, obovate-sub-circular, glabrous. Stamens somewhat exserted from the mouth; filaments linear, densely hairy to 4/5, glabrous distally; anthers c.6 x 1mm, each cell with a tail-like appendage (1–1.5mm) at the base. Disc sub-glabrous.
