## Description
Shrub to 3m. Twigs 2–3mm in diameter, rounded, sparsely scaly when young; internodes 2–12cm. Leaves 3–5 together in tight pseudowhorls. Blade 40–75 x 30–45mm, broadly elliptic or sub-obovate-elliptic, apex abruptly and shortly or gradually acuminate, obtuse, sometimes rounded or slightly emarginate, terminal gland thick, not protruding; margin flat; base broadly tapering or tapering; laxly scaly on both sides when young, glabrescent above, persistently laxly scaly beneath. Scales small, marginal zone variously lobed; centre slightly impressed. Mid-vein slightly or faintly impressed above, bluntly prominent in the proximal ½ beneath; lateral veins 5–7 per side, spreading, divided and curved-anastomosing before the margin, obscure above, a little raised beneath, reticulation inconspicuous. Petiole 5–10 x 1–1.5mm, grooved above, somewhat rugose, glabrous. Outer bracts to 15 x 8mm, ovate to obovate, innermost ones elliptic-spathulate, hairy on the outer middle line and at the apex, margin with fragile scales. Bracteoles c.15mm, linear-sub-spathulate to filiform, laxly hairy. Inflor­escence 2–5-flowered, an open umbel. Pedicels 10–27 x c.1mm, densely, shortly hairy, laxly scaly at both ends. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, oblique, disc-shaped, shortly obtusely 5-lobed, scaly and hairy outside. Corolla tubular, yellow shading to orange, especially at the lobes, and yellow or green on the tube; tube 25–35 x 7–10 x 15–20mm, straight, the base lobed, sparsely scaly outside, laxly hairy in the proximal 1⁄3 inside; lobes 15–25 x c.20mm, broadly obovate or sub-circular. Stamens unequal, regularly arranged around the flower, short ones at or a little beyond the mouth, longer ones exserted to c.12mm; filaments linear, yellow, densely and very shortly hairy in the proximal 1⁄3, glabrous distally; anthers 3–5 x c.1mm, blackish-purple, narrow-oblong, base with two short points. Disc slightly prominent, white-hairy on the upper margin. Ovary c.6 x 2.5mm, sub-cylindrical, abruptly contracted distally, white-hairy and scaly (scales hidden by the hairs); style 30–40mm, as long as the corolla tube, densely hairy and scaly proximally, becoming laxly so distally, glabrous for the 5–7mm below the stigma; stigma thick, 5-lobed. Fruit 30–34 x c.6mm, persistently appressed hairy, fusiform with longitudinal grooves.
