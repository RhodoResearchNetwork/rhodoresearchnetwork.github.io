## Description
Shrub. Twigs 2–3mm in diameter, rounded, initially scaly, early glabrescent; internodes 2–4cm. Leaves c.4 together in pseudowhorls. Blade 62–100 x 20–46mm, broadly elliptic to ovate; apex gradually and shortly acuminate, broadly acute; margin very narrowly or not revolute; base very broadly tapering to rounded, slightly unequal, glabrescent above, the scale attachments remaining recognisable as numerous minute, blackish pits; laxly sub-persistently scaly beneath. Scales small, marginal zone variously and shortly lobed, but later circular as the marginal zone disintegrates; centre slightly impressed. Mid-vein broadened proximally, wrinkled lengthwise, flat or a little impressed above, distinctly prominent beneath; lateral veins 10–12 per side, curved, spreading, arching inwards near the margin, clearly visible, impressed above, slightly raised beneath, reticulation dense, finely prominent beneath only. Petiole 7–11 x 2–2.5mm, rugose, flattened. Bracteoles linear, glabrous. Inflorescence c.8-flowered. Pedicels 17–21 x 1mm, sparsely scaly at both ends. Calyx 3–4mm in diameter, oblique, disc-shaped, obtusely angled or very shortly lobed, almost glabrous. Corolla 45–50mm, tubular-funnel-shaped, pale pink; tube 20–24 x 5–6 x c.10mm, glabrous outside, laxly hairy in the lower 2⁄3 inside; lobes 23–27 x 10–16mm, spathulate, spreading. Stamens shortly exserted; filaments linear and sub-densely patently hairy proximally, narrower and glabrous in the distal ½; anthers c.4 x 1mm, oblong, curved, base obtuse. Disc prominent, shortly hairy. Ovary 6–8 x c.2.5mm, sub-cylindrical, densely hairy, with numerous minute scales clearly visible between the hairs, gradually tapering distally; style slender, hairy in the lower ¼–1⁄3, c.20mm; stigma c.2.5mm in diameter, rounded.
