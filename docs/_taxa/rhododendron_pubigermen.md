## Description
Shrub to 1.2m; branches slender, spreading. Twigs 1–2mm in diameter, rounded, densely sub-stellately scaly and sparsely patently hairy; internodes 1–6cm. Leaves 3–12 together in pseudowhorls at the upper 2–3 nodes. Blade 20–40 x 6–12mm, spathulate to broadly elliptic, usually broadest in the upper ½; apex obtuse to rounded sometimes minutely emarginate; margin slightly revolute when living, more so when dry; base gradually tapering, scaly on both sides initially, glabrous above at maturity, sub-densely and more persistently scaly beneath. Scales flat, pale-brown, with the marginal zone relatively narrow, irregularly and shallowly lobed; centres small, and impressed. Mid-vein impressed above, strongly prominent in the proximal ½ beneath; lateral veins not visible. Petiole 1–2.5 x 1–2mm, weakly grooved above, flattened, densely scaly, not clearly distinct from the leaf base. Flower buds ovoid, to 8 x 6mm, the bracts completely appressed, shiny green when young, becoming purplish-red. Bracts to 7 x 5mm, sub-circular-ovate; outer ones obtuse, rough outside; inner ones sub-acuminate, glabrous and shiny outside; margins fringed with scales. Bracteoles c.8mm, linear-sub-spathulate, glabrous. Inflor­escence of 1–4 flowers, horizontal to half-hanging. Pedicels 10–15 x c.1mm, densely scaly and minutely hairy. Calyx c.3mm in diameter, oblique, shortly cup-shaped, shortly 5-lobed. Corolla 13–16 x 16–27mm, open-campanulate, lobed to halfway or slightly more, fleshy, deep red, and sometimes with a musky scent; tube 7–10 x 5–8 x 10–12mm, laxly or sub-densely sub-stellately scaly outside, glabrous inside, straight; lobes 8–10 x 6–8mm, broadly obovate-sub-spathulate, half-spreading, not overlapping in the fully open state, scaly except near the margins. Stamens equally distributed regularly all round the mouth of the flower, sometimes with a small gap on the lower side, slightly alternately unequal, exserted to c.5mm; filaments linear, patently hairy proximally for 1–2mm, glabrous distally; anthers broadly oblong, 2mm. Disc prominent, glabrous. Ovary c.3.5 x 2.5mm, ovoid, densely covered with long, spreading, white, hairs which cover the scales, abruptly contracted distally; style 5–8mm, glabrous; stigma sub-globose, green. Fruit 15–20 x 6mm, narrowly elliptic, persistently sub-densely long-hairy, laxly scaly, the valves twisting after opening. Seeds 3.5–4.5mm, without tails 0.7–0.8mm, the longest tail c.2mm, irregularly crimped.
