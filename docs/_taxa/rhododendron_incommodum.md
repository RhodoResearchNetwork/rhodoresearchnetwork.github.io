Blade 50–75 x 25–40mm, elliptic; apex broadly and obtusely acuminate; margin slightly revolute proximally; base tapering, sub-densely and persistently scaly beneath; laxly scaly initially, finally glabrescent above. Scales small, round, entire or nearly so, yellowish, somewhat impressed. Mid-vein a little impressed above; beneath strong and very prominent in the proximal part, gradually less so distally; lateral veins 4–6 per side at an acute angle with the mid-vein, obscurely anastomosing, slightly impressed above, raised beneath, reticulation obscure. Petiole 4–20 x c.1.5mm, semi-circular, rugose. Bracteoles filiform, very sparsely scaly. Inflorescence a c.8-flowered open umbel. Pedicels c.10 x 0.5mm, slender, sub-densely covered with pale yellow scales. Calyx c.2.5mm in diameter, sub-obliquely disc-shaped, wavy, very shortly 5-lobed. Corolla tubular, 50–55mm, red; tube 35–40 x 3 x 10mm, straight or slightly curved, laxly to sub-densely covered with small yellowish scales outside, very laxly hairy and sparingly scaly inside; lobes 10–15 x 5–7mm, obovate or elliptic-obovate, spreading, very sparsely scaly outside, glabrous inside. Stamens well exserted from the mouth; filaments filiform, sparsely hairy especially proximally, glabrous distally or completely glabrous; anthers 2–3 x 1mm, obovate-oblong, base obtuse.
