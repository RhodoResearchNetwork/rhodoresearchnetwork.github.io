## Description
Shrub to 1m. Twigs c.4mm in diameter, green, rounded, laxly to sub-densely, pale-brown scaly and minutely, sparsely shortly patently hairy; internodes 2–12cm. Leaves loosely spirally arranged along the stem. Blade 50–100 x 43–60mm, broadly ovate or ovate-elliptic, occasionally broadly elliptic; apex obtuse, rarely rounded and mucronate but without an obvious apical gland; margin entire, flat, with a thin (c.0.5mm), reddish-purple edge; base distinctly cordate, occasionally broadly tapering and then with translucent auricles at the base of the lamina; glabrescent above, laxly and more persistently scaly beneath. Scales stellate, pale-brown, marginal zone appressed to the leaf surface; centres small and impressed. Mid-vein strongly raised above for about ¾ of the length of the leaf, slightly raised beneath or shallowly impressed in the proximal ½; lateral veins 7–10 per side, spreading almost perpendicularly, strongly raised above, the leaf surface deeply sulcate between the veins, dis­appearing before the margin, reticulation weak or obscure. Petiole 10–23 x 4–5mm, reddish-purple, rounded above, without a groove, sparsely to sub-densely scaly. Flower buds ovoid, 20–35 x 15–22mm, bracts firmly appressed except for a very short point. Outer bracts translucent, truncate to emarginate, almost glabrous, with just a few small scales outside but without any on the margins. Inflorescence a 5–8-flowered open umbel, the flowers held horizontally. Pedicels 34–38 x c.3mm, shortly, white, patent-hairy and with a few papillae towards the distal end but without scales. Calyx green, glabrous or with a few low, irregular papillae. Corolla 55–65 x 50–60mm, bright golden yellow, often flushed with orange on the tube and around the edges of the lobes, without scent; tube c.30 x 12 x 22mm, funnel-shaped, glabrous outside but densely shortly white, patent-hairy in the proximal ½ inside, conspicuously 5-lobed at the base; lobes 35 x 27mm, spreading almost at a right angle and overlapping to over halfway, glabrous. Stamens irregularly spreading around the mouth of the flower, occasionally in two groups, slightly dimorphic; filaments white, densely white hairy proximally, the hairs thinning distally and becoming glabrous for the uppermost 2⁄3; anthers c.4 x 1mm, arching inwards, tapering towards the base which is distinctly apiculate. Disc purplish-brown, lobed, shortly white hairy on the upper side. Ovary 10 x 5mm, green, sparsely patently white hairy and with a few rounded silvery scales, abruptly tapering distally; style 20 x 1.5mm, glabrous, green, slightly broadened to the pink, circular but 5-lobed stigma. Fruit 20–30 x 8–10mm, green or flushed red, often flecked with white, fusiform. Seeds c.3mm, without tails 0.8mm, the longest tail 1.5mm.
