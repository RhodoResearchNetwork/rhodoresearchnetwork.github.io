## Description
Erect to spreading shrub to 1.2m. Twigs rounded, minutely rough with the dense covering of dark-brown overlapping scales. Leaves 5–7 together in tight pseudo­whorls; 2–6cm apart. Blade 25–40 x 7–12mm, narrowly elliptic with an obtusely pointed to rounded apex; margin entire but slightly uneven, flat; base tapering; quickly glabrescent above; densely persistently scaly below, the scales partially overlapping or the gaps between scales less than the width of the smaller scales. Scales with a broad lobed and striate flange and large darker, swollen centre. Mid-vein impressed above, very prominent beneath; lateral veins 2–4 per side, wide-spreading, almost to the perpendicular, hardly distinct beneath, but moderately distinct and impressed above. Petiole 5–7 x 1.5mm, distinctly grooved above, densely dark-brown scaly. Flower buds narrowly ellipsoid, smooth, green, with brown scales only in the basal 1⁄3, imbricate. Bracts: the basal with brown scales outside, upper ones glabrous but all finely fringed with white hairs. Inflorescence of 1–4 flowers hanging vertically downwards. Pedicels 15 x 1mm, green and densely covered in brown scales. Calyx a low, brown, scaly disc. Corolla 26 x 18mm, purplish-pink, pale pink or greenish-white, without scent; tube 20 x 6 x 8mm, cylindrical, fluted and a little swollen at the base, laterally flattened, with scattered brown scales outside, glabrous inside; lobes 10 x 7mm, wide-spreading, with or without scales outside. Stamens irregularly arranged with more on the lower side of the corolla; filaments 24mm, glabrous, tapering from base to apex; anthers 2 x 1mm, pale orange-brown. Ovary 5 x 2mm, densely scaly; style 17mm, scaly in the proximal 4mm, otherwise glabrous, tapering upwards; stigma 1.5mm in diameter, green. Fruit 20–37 x 4mm, distinctly fluted and slightly curved, with the remains of the stigma curved upwards, opening lantern-like, the outer skin not peeling back. Seeds 5–6mm, without tails 0.7–0.8mm, the longest tail 3mm, distinctly wavy.
