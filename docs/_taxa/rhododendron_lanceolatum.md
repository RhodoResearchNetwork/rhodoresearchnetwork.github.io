## Description
Shrub to 1.2m. Twigs 2–3mm in diameter, green, rounded, smooth apart from a fine covering of pale brown scales becoming glabrescent; internodes 3.5–8cm. Leaves 3–7 large, together with several very slender scale leaves in well-marked pseudowhorls at the upper 1–3 nodes. Blade 70–120 x 25–45mm, narrowly ovate to elliptic, sub-sessile; apex acuminate, acute, often slightly curved; margin entire, flat or weakly revolute; base obtusely tapering to rounded and highly rugose; very densely scaly on both sides when young, above the scales, sparse and becoming glabrescent but leaving a pitted surface, beneath sub-densely and persistently scaly, especially at the base of the blade. Scales small, thin and flat, the marginal zone irregularly sub-stellately lobed; centre minute and shallowly impressed, leaving dark pits. Mid-vein broad and prominent and often coloured red in the proximal ½ above, but flat or slightly raised beneath; lateral veins 7–12 per side, very fine and obscure, wide-spreading, almost at right angles, curved and anastomosing before the margin, the lamina often thrown into folds on either side of the mid-vein, reticulation inconspicuous above, obscure below. Petiole 2–3 x 2–3mm, scaly, obscurely defined, (the leaves being almost sessile), without a groove, reddish in colour. Flower buds (see p.327) to 25 x 15mm, sub-spherical with a broadly pointed apex, brown with the bract tips spreading. Outer bracts subulate to ovate-acuminate, inner ones obovate to spathulate, apiculate, all sub-densely scaly outside. Bracteoles to 15mm, subulate-linear, scaly. Inflorescence 4–10-flowered in an open umbel. Flowers c.24 x 22mm, white, sometimes scented, horizontal or half-hanging. Pedicels 20–30 x 1–2mm, densely brown-scaly and shortly white-hairy. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, disc-shaped, with distinct, very short blunt lobes, scaly and hairy outside. Corolla sub-campanulate, lobed to 2⁄3; tube 7–10 x 4–6 x 10–15mm, densely scaly, glabrous or slightly hairy inside, with broad grooves in the proximal ½; lobes 12–16 x 8–13mm, sub-obovate, erect, not reflexing back, scaly outside where the lobes were not overlapping in bud, variously overlapping ¼–¾. Stamens spreading regularly all round the flower, slightly dimorphic; filaments white, hairy for ¾ of their length, c.10 and 12mm; anthers 3–4 x c.1mm, white, curved, narrowed towards the pores, base obtuse or very shortly bilobed. Disc of 10 rounded, greenish yellow lobes, hairy on the upper side. Ovary 4–5 x 3–3.5mm, conical, green but covered with white hairs but without scales, ridged in the proximal ½, obtusely contracted distally; style c.5mm, green, hairy in the proximal ½, straight in young flowers but bending to place the stigma at the side of the flower; stigma green, 1.5mm in diameter. Fruit c.25 x 5mm, not seen mature.
