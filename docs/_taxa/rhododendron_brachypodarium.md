## Description
Shrub to 3m. Twigs 2–3mm in diameter, densely scaly, greyish often whitish when dry; internodes 2–10cm. Leaves reflexed, 4–5 together in tight pseudowhorls. Blade 40–80 x 20–40mm, elliptic, obovate-elliptic to obovate; apex broadly tapering, obtuse or rounded; margin entire, wavy, flat or only slightly and narrowly revolute; base more broadly to narrowly tapering; sub-densely scaly on both sides initially, early glabrescent above, more slowly so beneath. Scales flat, marginal zone angular or dentate; centre small, slightly impressed. Mid-vein thick, grooved and strongly raised in the proximal ¼–1⁄3, then smooth or impressed above, beneath, strongly raised and gradually tapering throughout its length; lateral veins 7–10 per side, issuing at c.45°, almost smooth often obscure, reticulation obscure. Petiole 6–12 x 1.5–2mm, weakly grooved above, densely scaly initially. Bracts to 20 x 13mm, green when fresh, outer ones ovate, firm, scaly at apex and margin, fringed with scales, inner ones thinner, broadly spathulate, very laxly hairy in the proximal part on both sides, otherwise glabrous. Bracteoles to 18mm, filiform, laxly hairy. Inflorescence an 8–14-flowered open umbel. Pedicels 4–8 x 0.5mm, densely scaly. Calyx c.2mm in diameter, oblique, rim-like, obscurely lobed, scaly outside. Corolla narrowly trumpet-shaped, pure white, scented, 40–50mm; tube 23–40 x 2–2.5 x 2.5–3mm, straight or curved, densely stellately scaly outside, shortly hairy inside; lobes 10 x 4–5mm, spreading becoming strongly reflexed, obovate, not or hardly overlapping. Stamens irregularly centrally grouped, exserted to c.10mm; filaments narrowly linear and densely hairy in the proximal ¾, slender and glabrous distally; anthers 3–4mm, narrowly oblong, base obtuse. Disc slightly prominent, laxly short-hairy. Ovary c.8 x 1.3mm, narrowly cylindrical, dense white or yellowish hairs covering scales, tapering distally; style exserted from the mouth for c.5mm, densely hairy at the base, then more laxly hairy and densely scaly, exclusively scaly for the distal 1⁄3; stigma obconical, green.
