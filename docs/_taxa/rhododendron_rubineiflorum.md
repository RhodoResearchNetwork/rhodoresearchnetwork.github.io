## Description
Low shrub to 20cm. Twigs 0.75–1.5mm in diameter, covered with shortly stalked stellate scales and with very short white hairs, warty in the older glabrescent parts; internodes 1–4cm. Leaves 4–7 together in tight pseudo­whorls, with fragile cataphylls along the internodes. Blade 5–10 x 2–6mm, elliptic to ovate; apex broadly acute to obtuse; margin flat and entire; base broadly tapering to rounded, initially scaly on both sides, glabrous above at maturity, laxly but more persistently scaly beneath. Scales brown, flat rounded to sub-stellately lobed and slightly impressed, with small centres. Mid-vein impressed in the proximal 1⁄3 above, smooth and indistinct beneath; lateral veins not visible. Petiole 1–2 x c.0.5mm, not grooved above, densely brown-scaly and with very short white hairs. Flower buds to 6 x 3mm, narrowly ovoid with an acute apex, pale brown or pink, laxly scaly outside, the bract tips slightly spreading. Bracts narrowly ovate-acuminate, laxly scaly outside and along the margins. Bracteoles 4–5mm, linear. Pedicels 7–12 x c.1mm, slender, densely covered with dendroid-stellate scales and sparse white hairs. Flowers solitary or occasionally paired, held horizontally or half-hanging. Calyx obliquely cup-shaped, shortly obtusely 5-lobed, c.2mm in diameter, densely scaly. Corolla 15–20 x 25–35mm, broadly campanulate, red or pink; tube 10–12 x 7–8 x 9–10mm, laxly to moderately densely transparently scaly outside, glabrous inside; lobes 13–15 x 10–13mm, elliptic, spreading to reflexed, overlapping to c.¼. Stamens distinctly dimorphic, regularly arranged all round the mouth, the longest exserted to 1.5mm or all slightly included within the mouth; filaments 8 and 6.5mm, pink, linear, glabrous; anthers 0.7–1.2 x 0.4–0.6mm, oblong, dark-purplish-brown. Disc densely hairy along the upper margin. Ovary c.3 x 2mm, broadly sub-ovoid-cylindrical, gradually contracted distally, densely covered with short, patent hairs, less densely with scales between the hairs; style 4–4.5 x 1.5mm, sparsely hairy at the base or to 2⁄3 and sparsely scaly near the base; stigma c.2mm in diameter, green or red, globose. Fruit 12–15 x c.2mm, fusiform, pink, shortly hairy and scaly. Seeds 3–4mm including the tails.
