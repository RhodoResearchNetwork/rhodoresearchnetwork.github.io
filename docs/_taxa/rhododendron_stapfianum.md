## Description
Shrub to 2m. Twigs c.3mm in diameter, rounded, densely patently long, white-hairy and laxly covered with brown scales; internodes 1.5–4cm. Leaves in lax pseudo­whorls of 7–10 larger and 2–4 smaller leaves, sometimes sub-spirally arranged. Blade 30–55 x 9–20mm, elliptic, often appearing narrowly elliptic as it is strongly revolute; apex broadly acute, obtuse or rounded; margin entire, broadly revolute; base broadly tapering to rounded; densely white hairy and more laxly scaly both above and below. Scales with long narrow arms, sub-dendroid but not on raised epidermal tubercles. Mid-vein slightly raised above proximally, and then impressed distally to the apex, weakly raised below; lateral veins hardly visible in the fresh state, about 6 per side, narrowly angled, sometimes visible after drying. Petiole 2–5 x 2–4mm, with a shallow groove, densely hairy and scaly. Flower buds to 30 x 14mm, ellipsoid, pale green, smooth. Bracts broadly ovate to spathulate, densely appressed hairy outside and with a few very small brown scales, brown scaly and with some hairs along the margins, glabrous inside. Inflorescence an open umbel of 7–18 semi- or fully erect flowers. Pedicels 5–8 x 2mm, pale green, densely hairy and with a few pale scales. Calyx a low ring. Corolla 50 x 25mm, white, sweetly scented or without scent; tube 40–46 x 5 x 3mm, narrowing gradually from the base upwards, straight or slightly curved, sub-densely hairy and brown scaly outside, glabrous inside; lobes 15 x 9mm, not or hardly overlapping, strongly reflexed, scaly and hairy outside except near the margins. Stamens irregularly spread around the flower, exserted to c.10mm before reflexing back against the lobes; filaments white, c.58mm, glabrous; anthers c.1.75 x 1mm, pale-brown. Ovary c.8 x 2mm, cylindrical, densely hairy with semi-appressed white hairs and white scales; style 55 x 1mm, white or pale pink, hairy, the hairs spreading at the base, appressed above and with white scales to within 4mm of the apex; stigma hardly expanded, c.1mm in diameter, strongly exserted to 18mm. Fruit 30–40 x 6mm, the valves twisting on opening. Seeds 5mm, without tails 1.5mm, the longest tail 2.5mm.
