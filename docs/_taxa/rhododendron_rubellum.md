## Description
Erect branching tree to 5m. Twigs 3–5mm in diameter, rounded, densely stellately scaly, glabrescent on older parts; internodes 3–8cm. Leaves 4–5 together in pseudowhorls. Blade 40–100 x 25–40mm, broadly elliptic, or slightly obovate; apex shortly acuminate, apiculate; margin flat or slightly revolute; base broadly tapering or rounded to slightly sub-cordate, immature ones densely brown-scaly with fragile scales and early glabrescent, leaving the leaves rough with the persistent tubercles above; covered for a longer time beneath with a nearly woolly scaly covering but later leaving the undersurface also rough. Scales large, narrowly stellately divided to form dendroid, stellate hairs, each on top of an epidermal tubercle. Mid-vein flat or minutely impressed above, as wide as the petiole and very prominent proximally, gradually less so distally beneath; lateral veins 4–8 per side, at an acute angle, straight below, curved and anastomosing before the margin, forming a lax network with the veins, with indistinct reticulation above but very distinctly so below. Petiole 10–17 x 1.5–2mm, grooved above, densely scaly. Bracts 15–22 x 8–10mm; the outer bracts ovate, sub-obtuse; the inner ones spathulate, both densely hairy on both sides, or minutely hairy or even glabrous. Bracteoles 10–15 x 1–2mm, linear to very narrowly spathulate, laxly to densely patently hairy. Inflorescence a 3–8-flowered, open umbel, the flowers horizontal to half-hanging. Pedicels 8–15 x 1–2mm, densely brown, stellately scaly, but without hairs except immediately below the calyx. Calyx deeply divided into irregular triangular lobes, to 2mm, densely, shortly-hairy and scaly outside and often with a longer fringe of hairs. Corolla 40–65 x 30–40mm, tubular, zygomorphic, bright red; tube 30–45 x 6–8 x 10–15mm, very laxly scaly or glabrous outside, with patent or retrorse hairs inside, straight below, curved and gradually dilated upwards; lobes 12–20 x 10–16mm, semi-erect or spreading, irregular, the upper two much larger than the lower three, obovate-spathulate, sometimes nearly circular. Stamens exserted to 8mm, unequal, irregularly arranged all round the mouth; the filaments red, linear and densely patently hairy proximally below, gradually less so distally becoming completely glabrous for 6–10mm; anthers 2–5 x 1–1.25mm, elongate-oblong, the base obtuse. Disc glabrous at least at the base. Ovary 8–10 x 2.5–3mm, elongate-cylindrical, gradually tapering distally, very densely hairy in the lowest 1mm (which may be the upper margin of the disc), elsewhere densely brown-scaly and hairy with the scales more numerous than the hairs and clearly visible; style as long or a little longer than the corolla tube, laxly hairy and sparsely scaly in the lower 1⁄3–2⁄3, glabrous distally; stigma thickly conical-sub-globose. Fruit 30–35 x c.6mm, fusiform, densely brown hairy and scaly. Seeds filiform, 3–4mm, with a very narrow tail at both ends.
