## Description
Shrub or tree to 5m. Twigs c.3mm in diameter, initially laxly covered with scales and sometimes with very fine papillose hairs, later glabrescent but with thick raised leaf scars; internodes 1–4cm. Leaves 5–8 in dense pseudo­whorls. Blade 10–35 x 6–25mm, broadly elliptic, ovate- or obovate-elliptic or sub-circular; apex obtuse, often rounded-obtuse, sometimes slightly emarginate, with an inconspicuous apical gland; margin slightly recurved, distinctly crenulate; base rounded, cordate, or broadly tapering, sub-densely to laxly scaly on both sides initially, early glabrescent with minute pits above; more persistently scaly beneath. Scales irregularly crenate or lobed with a narrow marginal zone; centre often large, swollen and persistent, deeply impressed. Mid-vein narrow and slightly impressed above, broad and obtusely prominent beneath; lateral veins 5–6 per side, somewhat irregular, spreading, slightly impressed above in old leaves, inconspicuous beneath, reticulation lax and faintly impressed above, obscure beneath. Petiole 1.5–3 x 1–3mm, grooved above, flattened, rugose. Flower buds (see p.327) to 17 x 11mm, ovoid, green, with the points of the bracts standing erect away from the bud. Outer bracts ovate-acuminate, the dorsal mid-vein tapering to a short subulate acumen, hairy and laxly scaly outside, hairy inside, margins ciliate near the apex only; inner ones ovate-obtuse to spathulate. Bracteoles to 20 x 1mm, linear below, sub-spathulate distally. Inflorescence of 5–10 flowers in open umbels. Flowers semi-erect to half-hanging. Pedicels 12–24 x 1–2mm, sub-stellately scaly. Calyx 3–4mm in diameter, a low scaly disc, often revo­lute. Corolla 26 x 37mm, broadly funnel-shaped or sub-­campanulate, pink to deep red, strongly honey-scented; tube 15–18 x 4–5 x 12–15mm, sub-densely scaly outside, glabrous inside, straight, the base pouched; lobes 15–18 x 13–15mm, spreading, slightly reflexed, overlapping c.½, obovate-spathulate. Stamens sub-equal, at the mouth of the tube; filaments c.13mm, linear, glabrous, pink; anthers c.3mm, oblong, pale-brown, cells obtuse or narrowed into a short distinct basal apiculus. Disc prominent, glabrous. Ovary c.4–4.5 x 2–3mm, sub-ovoid-conical, apex obtuse, abruptly contracted distally, densely scaly and occasionally with some very sparse hairs; style 9 x 1mm, glabrous, or scaly at the base for c.1mm, red, as long as the stamens; stigma c.2mm in diameter, red, rounded. Fruit 14–18 x 7–8mm, ovoid-fusiform, brown-scaly. Seeds 1.7mm, without tails c.1mm, the longest tail 0.4mm.
