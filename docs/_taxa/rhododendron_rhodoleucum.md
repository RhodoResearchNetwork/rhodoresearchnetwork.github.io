## Description
Shrub to 4m. Twigs c.2mm in diameter, laxly scaly when young, internodes c.3–10cm. Leaves 4–6 together in tight pseudowhorls. Blade 30–70 x 20–60mm, broadly elliptic to broadly obovate-elliptic, sub-sessile; apex shortly and broadly tapering, obtuse, to almost rounded; margin flat; base deeply cordate, glabrescent with age above, laxly scaly beneath. Scales flat, small, marginal zone thin, wide, variously lobed; centre small, slightly impressed. Mid-vein narrowly impressed above, base as wide as the petiole, decreasing distally, grooved up to c.1⁄3 the length of the leaf, broadly prominent beneath in the proximal ½ but not strongly raised; lateral veins and reticulation smooth but distinct below, raised and very distinct above. Petiole 0–1 x 2–3mm, grooved, scaly. Bracteoles almost filiform. Pedicels c.15mm, thick, sub-densely or laxly stellate-scaly, without hairs. Inflorescence an open 4–7-flowered umbel. Calyx 2.5–3mm in diameter, very obliquely disc-shaped, indistinctly 5-lobed, scaly outside. Corolla 93 x 50mm, trumpet-ventricose, usually a little curved, pink at the base of the tube, fading to the white lobes, scented; tube 60–82 x 4–6 x 9–10mm, (up to 13mm in the widest part just above the middle), laxly scaly outside, with dense patent or retrorse hairs proximally inside, becoming more laxly so distally; lobes 15–21 x 15–22mm, perpendicularly spreading, obovate to sub-circular, overlapping 1⁄3–½. Stamens exserted to 12mm, from the mouth, irregularly clustered on the lower side of the flower, dimorphic; filaments white, linear and sub-densely hairy proximally, narrower and more laxly sub-patently hairy distally, glabrous in the upper ¼; anthers 3.5–4 x c.1mm, white or cream, narrowly oblong, base obtuse. Disc hairy on the upper margin. Ovary 7–8 x c.2mm, sub-cylindrical, densely appressed-hairy and scaly, tapering distally; style lying on the lower side of the corolla, slender, densely or more laxly hairy and laxly scaly in the proximal 2⁄3, then exclusively sparsely scaly for 3–4mm and glabrous distally; stigma thick-rounded, shortly 5-lobed, green becoming exserted to 18mm. Fruit fusiform, c.35–50 x 5mm.
