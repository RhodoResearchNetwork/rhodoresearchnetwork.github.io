## Description
Shrub to 1m. Twigs erect, rounded, 2–3mm in diameter, densely covered with low sub-circular scales, and sparsely very shortly hairy. Stems with prominent leaf scars and low rounded axillary protrusions. Leaves densely, spirally arranged. Blade 7–12 x 2–5mm, elliptic to narrowly elliptic, gradually acuminate; apex acute to obtuse; margin flat or slightly recurved sometimes slightly crenulate; base tapering, shiny dark green above, and gradually glabrescent, paler and sub-densely scaly beneath. Scales sessile, impressed, rounded, with the margin narrow, entire to undulate; centre large and dark brown. Mid-vein impressed above and obtusely raised beneath especially in the proximal ½, lateral veins obscure. Petiole 1–2.5 x c.1mm, grooved, laxly scaly and hairy above, densely scaly below, curved to a right angle with the blade. Flower buds 10–12 x 7–10mm, ovate, smooth with the bracts fully appressed, brown near the base and the tips of the bracts, otherwise green. Bracts to 7 x 4mm, gradual changing from the upper foliage leaves, ovate to obovate, apiculate, scaly in the distal ½ and with short appressed hairs outside throughout; fringed with long white hairs at the margins. Bracteoles to 6mm, filiform, hairy. Inflorescence 6–12-flowered, the flowers half-hanging to hanging. Pedicels 10–14 x c.1mm, pink, densely covered with patent hairs of various lengths and sparsely scaly. Calyx oblique, small, undulate, with white hairs and scales outside and at the margin, glabrous inside. Corolla 18–21 x 8–9mm, tubular, bright orange-red, without scent; tube 13–15 x 5–6 x 7–8mm, with long white patent hairs and small laxly spaced scales outside, glabrous inside; lobes 3–5 x c.4mm, straight not reflexed, overlapping up to c.¾, obovate, apex rounded, hairy and scaly along the midline to the apex. Stamens exserted to c.2mm, loosely clustered on the lower side of the mouth, unequal; filaments linear, glabrous; anthers oblong-ellipsoid, c.1.5mm. Disc glabrous. Ovary c.3 x 2mm, ovoid-conical, densely covered with overlapping scales, without hairs; style glabrous, green; stigma elongate-obconical. Fruit c.11 x 4–6mm, elongate-ovoid, densely scaly, 5-ribbed, with a c.10mm persistent style; valves half-spreading, slightly curved, not twisted, the placentae remaining firmly attached to the central column. Seeds 1.3–1.8mm, without tails c.1mm, the longest tail to 0.5mm. The very short tails are often highly branched.
