## Description
Low erect shrub to 60cm. Twigs short, stiff, 1.5–2mm in diameter, densely short-hairy and caducously scaly; internodes 2–4cm. Leaves crowded in the distal part of the upper 1–2 internodes, or in loose pseudowhorls of 4–9 leaves. Blade 10–25 x 7–14mm, elliptic to broadly elliptic; apex obtuse, often minutely apiculate; margin distinctly cartilaginous and minutely crenulate; base broadly tapering to rounded, above moderately densely and sub-persistently scaly, beneath laxly and persistently scaly. Scales brown, flat, angular or sub-stellately lobed; centre small and impressed. Mid-vein narrow, flat above, slightly prominent and purplish beneath; lateral veins 5–7 per side, the lower 2–3 pairs from or from somewhat above the base, the other higher from the mid-vein, all straight below, curved distally sometimes obscure and obscurely anastomosing, faintly impressed above, a little raised beneath, reticulation obscure. Petiole 2–4 x 1–1.5mm, grooved above, purplish-red, slightly flattened. Flower buds 13–24 x 6–10mm, green. Bracts ovate-oblong to broadly-oblong-sub-spathulate, apiculate or mucronate, rigidly membranous, purplish and shiny when dry, glabrous outside, margin caducously scaly. Inflorescence a 3–4-flowered open umbel. Flowers half-hanging, without scent. Pedicels densely sub-stellately scaly and shortly hairy, 15–20mm x c.1.5mm, elongating up to 35mm in fruit. Calyx c.3mm in diameter, membran­ous, disc-shaped, margin wavy and reflexed, very shortly obtusely 5-lobed. Corolla 28–35 x 20–34mm, deep pink; tube 21–26 x 6–9 x 10–11mm, straight, cylindrical but flaring in the upper 3–4mm, completely glabrous outside, sparsely hairy in the basal ½ inside; lobes 10–14 x 10–14mm, obovate, reflexed to the perpendicular, overlapping c.halfway. Stamens clustered centrally just inside the mouth; filaments linear, sparsely hairy in the basal 1⁄3, glabrous distally; anthers c.2 x 1mm, broadly oblong-elliptic. Disc glabrous. Ovary ovoid-conical, densely covered with distally directed white hairs which cover scales, abruptly contracted distally; style 8–10mm, slender, glabrous, except for some hairs at the base; stigma globose, deeply 5-lobed. Fruit 10–12 x c.6mm, erect, purple where exposed and with persistent white hairs. Seeds 1.6–1.8mm, without tails 0.5mm, the longest tail 0.7mm.

## Distribution
Indonesia, C Sulawesi, Latimodjong Range on Mt Rantemario

## Altitude


## Habitat
Growing amongst moss in open areas near the summit and hybridising with possibly R. celebicum although that species occurred much lower on the mountain in the forest. The hybrids were characterised by having longer leaves which lack the crenulations on the margin and longer flowers.
