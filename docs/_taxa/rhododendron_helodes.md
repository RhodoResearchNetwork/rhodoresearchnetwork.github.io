## Description
Shrub, with strong, spreading branches, to 50cm. Twigs c.3mm in diameter, rounded, densely covered with appressed sub-stellate scales becoming glabrescent; internodes 3.5–8cm. Leaves 4–6 together in pseudo­whorls at the upper 2–3 nodes. Blade 20–40 x 8–15mm, elliptic, broadly elliptic or rarely sub-obovate; apex shortl­y broadly acuminate, sub-acute or blunt, apiculate with a protruding gland; margin narrowly cartilaginous, irregularly crenulate with impressed scales or sub-entire; base broadly tapering and decurrent; laxly impressed-scaly or glabrescent above, more distinctly and persistently scaly beneath, but eventually glabrescent, leaving impressed, dark points, laxly scaly distally, dense and touching proximally, and on the petiole. Scales with a fragile, marginal transparent zone, large and variously lobed; centre more persistent, small and impressed. Mid-vein impressed in the proximal 2⁄3 above, dilated and obtusely prominent beneath, gradually disappearing distally; lateral veins 2 per side just above the base, high-ascending and with 2–3 other less conspicuous veins arising further from the base. Petiole 3–5 x 2–3mm, flat. Outer bracts few, short, ovate-subulate, inner ones to 18 x 7mm, more numerous, broadly obovate-spathulate, shortly acuminate, sub-acute, at first densely reddish-scaly, early glabrescent. Inflorescence 1–4-flowered. Pedicels 20–30 x c.1mm, very densely covered with red or orange, stellate scales, but without hairs. Calyx c.5mm in diameter, disc-shaped, scaly outside, the membranous margin reflexed and irregularly lobed, lobes up to 1mm and appressed to the corolla. Corolla 30–35mm, tubular, red or yellowish red; tube 20–25 x 6–7 x 10–12mm, slightly narrowed distally before becoming gradually dilated again to the mouth, sub-densely stellately scaly outside, glabrous inside; lobes 9–11 x 7–9mm, erect or spreading, broadly spathulate or sub-circular, very slightly emarginate, sub-densely scaly except near the margins. Stamens unequal, the longest as long as the corolla tube; filaments linear, glabrous; anthers c.2mm, obovate. Disc prominent, glabrous. Ovary c.8 x 3mm, sub-cylindrical, abruptly contracted distally, densely covered with white or yellowish hairs, which are directed forwards and cover numerous scales; style c.20mm, slender, exceeding the stamens in length, shortly hairy for 2mm proximally, glabrous distally; stigma globose.
