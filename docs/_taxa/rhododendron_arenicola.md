## Description
Erect shrub to 2m. Twigs rounded, densely pale-brown-scaly; internodes 3–8cm. Leaves scattered in the upper ½ of the upper 1–2 internodes. Blade 20–40 x 15–26mm, elliptic, broadly elliptic or rarely sub-ovate-elliptic; apex obtuse to very shortly acuminate or apiculate, with a blunt terminal gland; margin minutely crenulate, not or only very slightly revolute; base sub-truncate to rounded; very densely reddish brown-scaly beneath at least initially the scales forming a continuous layer. Scales lobed or rounded with a broad marginal flange, centres variable, slightly impressed, becoming glabrescent and then densely pitted. Mid-vein flat above, slightly prominent beneath; lateral veins 5–7 per side, the lower 2–3 from, or from slightly above, the base, the remainder straight at first, curving distally and obscurely anastomosing, faintly impressed above, slightly raised beneath, somewhat rugose above when mature. Petiole 3–4 x 2–3mm, not grooved above, flattened, scaly. Flower buds broadly ovoid, c.15 x 10mm. Bracts to 15 x 10mm; outer bracts ovate, inner ones sub-spathulate, blunt, with white silky hairs and also scaly along the midline outside. Bracteoles to 3mm, slender. Inflorescence 7–13-flowered, in an open umbel, hanging, without scent. Pedicels 15–25 x c.1mm, densely brown-scaly but without hairs. Calyx disc-shaped, c.3.5mm in diameter, densely scaly outside, the margin wavy and spreading, indistinctly, bluntly 5-lobed. Corolla 23–27 x 20–27mm, tubular- campanulate, pink; tube 12–18 x 6–7 x 9–11mm, a little pouched at the base, laxly to sub-densely scaly outside and with a few simple hairs outside at the base and a few inside near the base only; lobes 12 x 11mm, broadly obovate to nearly rounded, retuse or irregularly crenulate, spreading almost to the perpendicular, overlapping to c.halfway. Stamens regularly arranged in a circle, just included or slightly exceeding the corolla tube in length, weakly dimorphic; fila­ments 1–3mm, white, filiform, glabrous or with some sparse hairs near the base; anthers 18 x 1.2mm, brown, oblong. Disc glabrous or with dense long hairs on the upper side. Ovary 4–5 x 3–4mm, green, thick, conical, abruptly contracted to the style, covered with patent or somewhat distally pointed white hairs which obscure dense silvery scales; style 4–6mm, thick, glabrous; stigma large, sub- conical, distinctly 5-lobed, centrally placed.
