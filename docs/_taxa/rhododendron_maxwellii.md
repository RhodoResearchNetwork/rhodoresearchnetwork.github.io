Shrub to 2m. Twigs rounded, or fluted with longitudinal grooves in the youngest parts, 3–4mm in diameter, with small brown indistinct scales; internodes 2–9cm; lateral buds conspicuous, 3mm, conical. Leaves 3–5 large, and a few smaller together in distinct pseudowhorls. Blade 65–100 x 30–50mm, obovate or elliptic; apex rounded or retuse; margin slightly recurved; base broadly tapering; glabrescent above, laxly scaly but also often glabrescent beneath. Scales small, marginal zone variously lobed; centre dark, persistent, deeply impressed. Mid-vein strongly impressed above and raised below throughout its length; lateral veins 5–7 per side also slightly impressed above and raised below, dark-green above, paler green below. Petiole 7–12 x 4–6mm, strongly grooved above, initially with fine brown scales, green. Flower buds 14 x 9mm, ellipsoid, green or yellowish-green, with appressed, rounded or shortly apiculate bud scales. Inflorescence with 11–14 flowers held horizontally or half-hanging in an open umbel. Pedicels green or bright-red, densely scaly, sometimes also with hairs. Calyx a low ring covered in scales. Corolla c.26 x 30mm, shortly funnel-shaped, pale-yellow, often lightly flushed with pink outside on the tube, very strongly and sweetly scented; tube c.12 x 6 x 9mm, covered in scales and hairy inside at the base; lobes c.16 x 17mm, densely scaly outside, overlapping to c.halfway and broadly spreading nearly to the horizontal. Stamens evenly arranged in a circle at the mouth of the tube; filaments c.13mm, with patent hairs in the proximal 1⁄3; anthers 2.5–3.3 x c.0.8mm, oblong. Disc hairy at the upper margin. Ovary c.4 x 2.5mm, sub-conical, densely hairy and scaly; style 4–6 x c.2mm, patently hairy near the base only, cream; stigma c.2mm in diameter, green. Fruit c.15 x 7mm, ovoid-cylindrical.
