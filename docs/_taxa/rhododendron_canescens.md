## Description
Shrub or small tree to 6m tall, usually non-rhizomatous; young twigs red-brown, sparsely to densely covered with unicellular hairs and multicellular eglandular hairs, occasionally with only unicellular hairs, or with unicellular hairs and multicellular gland-tipped hairs, rarely glabrous. Vegetative bud scales densely covered with unicellular hairs abaxially; margin unicellular-ciliate or glandular. Leaf blade membranaceous, ovate or obovate to elliptic, (4.7-)5.9-8.5(-9.8) x (1.4-)1.9-2.8(-3.6)cm; base acute to oblique; apex acute to obtuse, often mucronate; adaxial surface sparsely to densely covered with unicellular hairs, or also with multicellular eglandular hairs, occasionally only with multicellular eglandular hairs, rarely with unicellular hairs and multicellular gland-tipped hairs, the midvein densely covered with unicellular hairs; abaxial surface sparsely to densely covered with unicellular hairs, rarely also with multicellular eglandular hairs, or glabrous, the midvein densely covered with unicellular hairs and multicellular eglandular hairs, or rarely with multicellular gland-tipped hairs or only unicellular hairs; margin entire, rarely minutely serrulate, ciliate with multicellular eglandular hairs, rarely with a few multicellular gland-tipped hairs at the base of the blade; petiole (0. l-)0.2-0.4(-0.5)cm long, sparsely to densely covered with unicellular hairs and multicellular eglandular hairs, occasionally with unicellular hairs and multicellular gland-tipped hairs, rarely with only unicellular hairs. Flower bud scales chestnut brown; abaxial surface densely covered with unicellular hairs; margin unicellular-ciliate, occasionally with both unicellular hairs and glands. Flowers appearing before or with the leaves; inflorescence a shortened raceme of 6 to 19 flowers. Pedicels (0.4-)0.5-l .0(-l .3)cm long, sparsely to densely covered with unicellular hairs and multicellular eglandular hairs, occasionally with unicellular hairs and multicellular gland-tipped hairs, rarely with all three types of hairs. Sepals less than 0.1-0.2(-0.4)cm long, often varying in length on the same flower; margins setose, occasionally also with multicellular gland-tipped hairs, or only glandular-fimbriate; abaxial surface densely covered with unicellular hairs, or also with multicellular eglandular hairs, occasionally with unicellular hairs and multicellular gland-tipped hairs, rarely with all three types of hairs. Corolla pink, or the tube pale to deep pink and the lobes pale pink to white, occasionally white or rose to deep pink throughout, fragrance musky-sweet, the tube longer than the limb and gradually expanding into it; upper corolla lobe (0.7-)0.8-l .3(-l .5) x (0.6-)0.7-l .0(-l .4)cm wide; lateral lobes (0.8-)1.0-1.5(-2.0) x (0.3-)0.5-0.8(-1.0)cm; corolla tube (1.3-)1.5-2.0(-2.6) long, (0. l-)0.2-0.3(-0.4)cm wide at base; outer surface of corolla densely covered with unicellular hairs and sparsely to densely covered with multicellular gland-tipped hairs that occasionally continue up the corolla lobes; inner surface of corolla sparsely to densely covered with terete or rarely flattened unicellular hairs. Stamens (3.1-)4.4-5.7(-6.4)cm long, with dense terete or flattened unicellular hairs on proximal (0.0-)2.0-3.1(-4.1)cm of filament, exserted (1.7-)2.5-3.6(-4.5)cm beyond throat of corolla. Style (3.7-)4.4-5.7(-6.8)cm long, exserted (2.0-)2.7-3.9(-4.8)cm beyond throat of corolla, with dense unicellular hairs on proximal (0.0-)0.7-2.0(-3.3)cm; stigma 0. l-0.2cm wide. Ovary 0.3-0.4(-0.5)cm long, 0. l-0.2(-0.3)cm wide at the base, densely covered with unicellular hairs and multicellular eglandular hairs, occasionally also with multicellular gland-tipped hairs, or with unicellular hairs and multicellular gland-tipped hairs; the multicellular hairs may cover the unicellular hairs or may only occur on the ribs of the ovary; the nectary is crowned with a dense ring of unicellular hairs. Capsules (1.2ó)1.5ó2.1(ó2.5) x 0.3-0.5cm wide, narrowly ovate to cylindric, moderately to densely covered with unicellular hairs and sparsely to moderately covered with multicellular eglandular hairs. Seeds pale to dark chestnut brown, ovate or elliptic to fusiform, (1.2-) 1.6-2.5(-3.0) x (0.3-)0.5-0.8(-l.l)mm, body (0.6-)0.8-1.2(-1.4) x (0.1-)0.3-0.5(-0.6)mm; testa expanded and dorsiventrally flattened, surrounding the body, with both elongate and short cells scattered throughout the testa, the short eels more common in the expanded portion of the testa, with tapering end-walls
