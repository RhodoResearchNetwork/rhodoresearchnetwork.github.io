Inflorescence buds lateral, spaced along the shoots of the previous year, above leaf scars, 1-2-flowcred, flowers pendulous, borne below the expanded leaves; bud scales mostly fallen at anthesis; pedicels up to c. 10 mm long, with a minute glandular indumentum, and strigose hairs around the base. Calyx lobes oblong-ligulate, deeply divided, c.8 x 3-4 mm, with glandular hairs on the margin and strigose and glandular hairs on the outer surface. Corolla bowl-shaped, almost actino-morphic, c.20 mm across, with a short tube and spreading lobes, white (rarely marked with yellow), usually minutely puberulous on the inner and outer surfaces. Stamens 10(12 in rare6-merous flowers) equal, filaments c.lOmm long, pilose below. Ovary globose, 2 mm long, setose and glandular; style straight, impressed, pilose below.
