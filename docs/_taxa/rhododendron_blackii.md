## Description
Shrub to 3m. Twigs 3–4mm in diameter, rounded, sub-densely scaly, longitudinally striate when dry; internodes 5–13cm. Leaves in tight pseudowhorls of 3–4, but inserted over 1–2cm. Blade 40–75 x 30–65mm, ovate to circular, rarely obovate; apex obtuse to rounded; margin cartilaginous, entire, narrowly revolute; base auriculate, the sides broadly turned down; laxly silvery scaly above, quickly becoming glabrescent; below laxly to sub-densely and more persistently scaly. Scales sub-circular to broadly sub-stellately lobed; the marginal flange broad, thin and transparent, the centres moderately small and impressed. Mid-vein raised above in the proximal 1⁄3–½, then impressed, grooved where it is raised; below raised throughout its length but decreasing distally; lateral veins 5–7 per side, wide-spreading, above slightly raised and minutely grooved, beneath very slightly raised; straight but branching and anastomosing before the margin. Petiole 2–4 x 2–4mm, sometimes grooved above distally, scaly. Bracts to 18 x 12mm, the outermost scaly outside, inner ones with scales on the margins, shortly hairy outside and minutely hairy inside. Inflorescence of 5–9 flowers in an open umbel. Flowers 60–65 x 35–40mm. Pedicels 30–35 x c.1mm, densely scaly. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, disc-shaped, densely scaly and fringed on the margin with scales. Corolla red; tube 40–62 x 5–6 x 12–27mm, sub-densely scaly outside, densely hairy with irregular or somewhat retrorse hairs inside; lobes 15–23 x 12–21mm, reflexed, overlapping to c.halfway, scaly outside except near the margins. Stamens exserted to c.12mm, clustered on the upper side of the mouth; filaments hairy in the proximal ½–2⁄3, glabrous distally; anthers c.3mm, curved. Disc densely hairy on the upper side, otherwise glabrous. Ovary c.8 x 3mm, elongate-conical, densely hairy and scaly, tapering gradually distally; style c.45 x 1mm, densely hairy and scaly for the proximal 3–5mm, then glabrous distally, purplish-red; stigma c.4mm in diameter, rounded, yellow. Fruit 28–38 x 6–7mm, fusiform, longitudinally grooved, pale brown.
