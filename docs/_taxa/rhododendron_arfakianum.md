## Description
Shrub to 2.5m. Twigs 2–3mm in diameter, sparsely scaly and papillose-hairy in the youngest parts, becoming glabrescent; internodes 2–10cm. Leaves 3–5 together in tight pseudowhorls. Blade 40–100 x 15–45mm, obovate-elliptic; apex obtusely tapering or nearly rounded; margin entire, slightly revolute in dry specimens; base tapering or broadly tapering, glabrescent above when mature, sub-persistently and sub-densely to laxly scaly beneath. Scales small, with the marginal zone irregularly lobed and a minute dark centre, slightly impressed, each scale surrounded by a dark halo, also very finely punctate by minute emergences of the epidermis beneath. Mid-vein slightly depressed and with minute, papillose, spreading hairs above, as wide as the petiole and obtusely prominent in the lower part beneath; lateral veins 6–10 per side, spreading, obscurely inarched at the margin, slightly prominent on both sides, reticulation inconspicuous. Petiole 6–12 x 1–1.5mm, with minute, papillose, spreading hairs above. Outer bracts to 15 x 8mm, ovate, obtuse, inner ones oblong-obovate, laxly scaly and minutely hairy outside, becoming glabrescent, fringed with scales. Bracteoles to 23 x 0.5–4mm, filiform below, spathulate distally, papillose. Inflorescence a 4–10-flowered umbel. Pedicels 8–12mm, slender, laxly to sub-densely scaly and finely patently hairy. Calyx c.3mm in diameter, disc-shaped, membranous, sub-obtusely and very shortly unequally lobed, wavy, spreading to reflexed, glabrous outside, distinctly ciliate. Corolla 25–35mm, tubular below, expanded upwards, oblique, deep pink; tube 15–20 x 3–4 x c.5mm, sub-cylindrical, straight or slightly curved, glabrous outside, laxly hairy inside; lobes 7–10 x 5–8mm, sub-erect, or somewhat spreading, obovate-spathulate. Stamens spreading all round the mouth, unequal, the longest as long as the corolla; filaments linear and laxly hairy below, filiform and glabrous distally; anthers 2mm, obovate. Disc shortly hairy. Ovary c.4 x 2mm, sub-cylindrical, densely short-hairy and minutely scaly (the scales covered by hairs), abruptly contracted distally; style slender, sometimes with some hairs at the very base, equalling the stamens in length; stigma club-shaped, obconical, oblique. Fruit (sub-mature) 20 x 4mm, fusiform, densely hairy, surmounted by the glabrous, 20mm style.
