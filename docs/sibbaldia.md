# Living collections as a community hub to support the survival and continued enjoyment of Rhododendron in a changing world

### Special Issue Aim and Objectives:
Colorful, abundant floral displays make Rhododendron one of the world’s most popular garden plants, and their diversity of habits, leaf types and climate tolerance make them popular elements in botanical garden collections. Early on, many Rhododendron collections focused primarily on displaying landscape plants with exceptional ornamental value, but climate change and other anthropogenic impacts present increasing challenges, both in collections and native populations, spurring increased interest in research and conservation. Today, botanical gardens contribute substantially to conservation programs by curating ex-situ collections, but also via research on cultural practices and climate tolerance, and by engaging members of the public. The high biodiversity and charisma of Rhododendron combined with their visibility in living collections makes them excellent choices for fostering wider community engagement, bringing together horticulturalists with people from many other walks of life to solve big-picture conservation challenges. Toward this end, we are soliciting articles that highlight programs and opportunities in Rhododendron living collections that feature, or would benefit from, collaboration between different members of the wider Rhododendron community, e.g. horticulturalists working alongside researchers or conservationists working with members of the public, to develop and implement creative solutions for the survival and continued enjoyment of Rhododendron in a changing world.
