## Special Issue: Rhododendron in living collections: collaboration, conservation and cultivation

### Aim and Objectives:
Colourful floral displays make Rhododendron one of the world’s most popular garden plants. Their diverse habits, leaf types and climate tolerances make them popular elements in botanic garden collections. Many collections have previously focused on displays of plants with exceptional landscape and ornamental value, but climate change and other anthropogenic impacts present increasing challenges, both in collections and native populations, spurring an increase in research and conservation activities. Today, botanic gardens contribute substantially to conservation programmes by curating ex situ collections, with research into cultivation and climate tolerance, and by engaging members of the public. The diversity and charisma of rhododendrons combined with their visibility in gardens make them excellent choices for fostering community engagement, bringing horticulturists and other professions together to solve conservation challenges. Projects implementing creative solutions for the persistence and continued enjoyment of rhododendrons can be found in gardens around the world. Toward this end, the Rhododendron Research Network will guest edit a special issue of Sibbaldia. This is a call for submissions that highlight programmes and opportunities in living collections that feature, or would benefit from, collaboration between members of the community that curates, cultivates and carries out research on the genus Rhododendron. Submissions describing the curation, cultivation, research and public engagement with living collections for conservation outcomes will be welcomed for consideration.
