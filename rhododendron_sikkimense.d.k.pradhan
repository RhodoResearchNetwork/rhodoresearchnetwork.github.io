## Remarks  
Pradhan and Lachungpa (1990) did not cite a holotype so thier name is invalidly published. Pradhan (2023) validated the publication, but cited it as a nom. nov., rather than a tax. nov. and with the aa correctable typographic error in the epithet ending -ensis rather than, -ense. He also cited the Edinburgh specimen as a lectotype rather than a holotype, this is correctable under Art. 40.1 of the Mardid code.

This record will recieve new IPNI and WFO IDs, the author string and publication details will be updated to reflect the data in those records.
